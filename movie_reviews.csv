19 July 2023,9," Murphy is exceptional
",/review/rw9199470/?ref_=tt_urv,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."
20 July 2023,8," A challenging watch to be sure, but a worthwhile one.
",/review/rw9202448/?ref_=tt_urv,"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film."
20 July 2023,10," A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws
",/review/rw9202246/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws."

",/review/rw9202236/?ref_=tt_urv,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves."

",/review/rw9202525/?ref_=tt_urv,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure."

22 July 2023,8," Technically superb but...
",/review/rw9205774/?ref_=tt_urv,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable."

I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8."
1 September 2023,8," Oppenheimers Victims are barely acknowledged
",/review/rw9298252/?ref_=tt_urv,"For every minute that passes during the 3-hour run time of the movie Oppenheimer, 1200 citizens in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki died. If you haven't got to see the movie it's worth pointing out that Oppenheimer - is not an anti nuclear movie. Nor is it a dramatic reconstruction of the devastating consequences of the use of the first nuclear bombs against the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For this, you would be better advised to seek out the superior acclaimed BBC drama documentary Hiroshima (2005.)
That film graphically dramatised what it is like to live through a Nuclear attack, millisecond by horror filled millisecond."

The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!"

I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent.

",/review/rw9199916/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade."
22 July 2023,7," I Wish I Could Say I Had A Blast
",/review/rw9205912/?ref_=tt_urv,"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone."

Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before."
22 July 2023,6," Half an Hour too long, misses the point
",/review/rw9208021/?ref_=tt_urv,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up."
22 July 2023,9," superior filmmaking and historical storytelling
",/review/rw9207372/?ref_=tt_urv,"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening."
3 August 2023,6," Too loud and too long
",/review/rw9235272/?ref_=tt_urv,"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime."
4 August 2023,4," Pearls before swine
",/review/rw9238031/?ref_=tt_urv,"First of all, I love Christoper Nolan's work. He's the only director whose films I always see in a cinema. But it's clear that he's is now so powerful that no one has the guts to tell him no. He's almost the Stephen King of film making these days, with the end results too often overly long and meandering. Perhaps my Nolan cinema-first policy will end after Oppenheimer."
28 July 2023,," Overall a disappointing experience.
",/review/rw9221158/?ref_=tt_urv,"Although the time passed quickly, ultimately, Oppenheimer has left me disappointed. The problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. Both of those stories are depicted well, Nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. However, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. The film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white IMAX film stock."
2 August 2023,8," A Very Nolan Film
",/review/rw9233822/?ref_=tt_urv,"I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart."
19 July 2023,10," Nolan's best so far?

19 July 2023,9," Nolan at his best!
",/review/rw9199902/?ref_=tt_urv,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator."
21 July 2023,8," Do the means justify the end?
",/review/rw9203717/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home."

",/review/rw9257390/?ref_=tt_urv,"Maybe my expectations were off slightly. This was a character study into Oppenheimer and the tribulations of his career, and about his politics rather than truly about the science and production of the A bomb. I was hoping to see more nitty gritty into the bomb's development, and maybe some footage of its use in Japan to really reinforce the human toll and destruction of the immensely powerful weapon that they had created for the final act. Instead its just dramatic closeups of Opp's troubled face. But I feel we needed some more visuals (of war) to establish more emotion. It felt exceedingly anticlimactic."

",/review/rw9204351/?ref_=tt_urv,"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie."

",/review/rw9200172/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity."

Important though, he might be onto something. Important in the way the latter part of the picture emphasizes Robert J.

The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience.

I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story.

The fact that there isn't a lot of suspense is understandable as we all know that the Atom bombs would be dropped in the end, so suspense is attempted through chopping up the timeline and scattering it throughout the movie.

",/review/rw9206740/?ref_=tt_urv,"Like Martin Scorsese and Alfred Hitchcock before him Christopher Nolan is one of the few directors who can guarantee a paying audience as surely as any of the big box-office draws in the acting profession. A film-maker of great skill he has nevertheless often eschewed 'seriousness' to work, if not necessarily in the 'popcorn' market, then certainly in the commercial field and that's where he has built up his following. But what will his followers think of ""Oppenheimer""? Will today's movie-going generation even know who J. Robert Oppenheimer was, (at the full-house screening I attended I saw two people leave), and can Nolan do justice to his subject?"

",/review/rw9215422/?ref_=tt_urv,"My expectations are always high for a film made by Christopher Nolan who oversees the whole production whilst directing and writing it, he never lets me down and for this feature film, a biopic about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. What we get is a three hour biopic of Oppenheimer's life and in my opinion each minute and each scene is used to the fullest. My girlfriend thought it was too long though so I think it's a preference. You could say the black and white scenes which have a different perspective character entirely, to be unnecessary for the story told and that's fair, but in my opinion it's a perspective character which is needed. Stories can easily become biased but with a perspective character like Strauss makes us see how others see Robert Oppenheimer and it only helps the story Christopher Nolan is telling. Any fan of Christopher Nolan knows how he likes a non linear story, he does it here and It's done perfectly. Alternating between Oppenheimer's story from Cambridge to Los Alamos, his security hearing in 1954, and Strauss' confirmation hearing in 1959."

Murphy and Downey, Jr. Should be Oscar winners if there is any justice. But there's not a false note in the ensemble. Robert Oppenheimer is fascinating character. Hero or villain? The film gives us both perspectives and lets us decide for ourselves. The non linear storytelling works brilliantly because what could have seemed like two films works seamlessly as one. Three hours flies by. While I am not a Christopher Nolan fanatic, after seeing this, I have to admit the man is a genius. Cannot wait to see it again."

14 August 2023,6," Excellent acting ruined by excessive pace
",/review/rw9258711/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan movies have always been fairly demanding of the viewer, but I think Oppenheimer finally takes it a step too far. The acting is superb and the subject interesting, but the pacing of the movie demands that the viewer is either 100 years old and has a clear recollection of the time, or has been researching the topic for the past several years in order to fully understand what is happening. The movie feels like a 3 hour long trailer, a speeding train that never slows down to allow the audience to catch their breath. There was a lot of great dialogue delivered by fantastic actors, but it is so mired in jump cuts and overly loud continuous music that it feels like a massive missed opportunity. The best way I can describe it is someone trying to perform a poetry reading in the middle of a techno concert. The movie certainly peaked my interest in Oppenheimer, and I will probably research this time in history more, but I am glad the movie is over."

He's depicted as a creature of emotions. The fact that he's womanising is not clearly depicted. The only character that I am thoroughly impressed with and the only character that have driven this lose movie is Robert Downey Jr.'s character.

It's a terrifically absorbing and gloriously verbose film about the creation of the Atomic bomb, like the pure joy of watching science nerds writing feverishly on chalkboards (and the jar of marbles), but that's just part of it."

He is an auteur for sure, but also one of the messiest ones, in my opinion. This story of Oppenheimer, so brilliantly and absorbingly portrayed on-screen by Nolan, is also frustrating at times because of his tendency to go back to his trademarks: twists, over-dramatization, and a complex time-jumping storyline. If you mix a standard biopic, with all of the elements of narrative of The Dark Knight, Interstellar, or Tenet, this is what you get. It's certainly not a bad thing, but at times just unnecessary."

This was also the best performance by Emily Blunt I think ever. Matt Damon was fantastic, and Florence was too. Loved the small roles of 3 Academy Award winners with Affleck being terrifying with just a little screen time, Oldman being unrecognizable and Malek stealing the last 20 minutes of the film. Hoyte van Hoytema once again made fantastic cinematography one of his best and Ludwig Göransson ATE that score. I think it's one of the best scores in a film ever. Period!

I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself.

Oppenheimer talking to Einstein about the chain reaction they thought it will happen when bombing the nuclear bomb and cause the burning of atmosphere and all the world with it this of course didn't happen, but Oppenheimer realized that he already started it inventing the nuclear bomb knowing that all countries will race to have as many nuclear bomb and even advanced on as they can, and imagining that someday they will start a nuclear war that will destroy all the world. This is a scene that i think i'll never forget for all my lifetime

",/review/rw9212582/?ref_=tt_urv,"In recent years, usually when a film has such a packed cast it often never met expectations so I didn't have many for this, I was confident it was gonna be good but refrained from gauging how good it could actually be. Quoting Greek mythology really set the tone for the rest of the movie. Christopher Nolan is known for blending some sci-fi to his more renowned movies; this is a history biopic but has a lot of elements resembling sci-fi. Building something that at the time period, could only be a pigment of one's imagination. The movie blends together mythology, physics, betrayal, history, philosophy, politics and moral conundrums... maybe this is recency bias but I think this is one of Christopher Nolan's best work."

",/review/rw9204725/?ref_=tt_urv,"Might sound absolutely blasphemous but I think this is better watched at home. This is not against the quality of the filmmaking, which was understandably amazing but the tediousness of it being an unintentional Oscar bait. There are tooo many characters, most looking similar and too dialogue heavy to be watching in theatres. The soundmixing leaves a lot of the dialogue to the imagination as well. What I expected from it was not what I walked away with, this is not about the bomb rather than the political side of the bomb. So be prepared to sit through endless courtroom back-and-forth with characters introduced in almost every scene. If you are not already aware of exactly what happened to Oppenheimer esp his life after the bomb, you're gonna have a really hard time understanding whats going on. Thats where the paradox lies, can it be a masterfully crafted movie if you lose your audience before the credits? Because it absolutely is and most around me absolutely were. And then if you are already aware of everything that happened to Oppenheimer was it really necessary to play the plot twist game with a certain character throughout the entire movie? The whole movie was a bit of oxymoron, you get to see what you prolly didnt want to and didnt get to see what you most wanted to. I'm talking about the bomb obviously, I was heavily disappointed by the absence of it. The saving grace was the amazing acting performance by RDJ and Emily Blunt who both should be receiving Oscar nominations. Cillian Murphy did a great job as well but there were many scenes where I felt like I was watching Tommy Shelby instead of Robert Oppenheimer. The best part of watching Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was when he had no dialogues because his eyes do a better job at portraying what Nolan was going for. There is surprisingly little of the Nolan ""practical effect mindbending scene that needs to be seen in cinemas"". This was easier to follow and harder to watch than TENET."
21 July 2023,10," Oppenheimer is an absolutely thought provoking, cinematic masterpiece.
",/review/rw9204809/?ref_=tt_urv,"To everybody saying it's too boring, it's too long and there's too much talking, this movie is based off a biography of Oppenheimer's life during the Manhattan Project, the Trinity Test, and everything that ensured after. This wasn't a movie about the bomb but what it represents. Just like the splitting of the atom starting a chain reaction that detonates, the birth of the atom bomb started a chain reaction of destruction and fear that is still felt to this day. The movie does an amazing job at getting the viewer to feel the emotions that Oppenheimer felt after seeing the aftermath of his creation. Devastation. The way they used imagery and camera work to accurately depict his fragile mental psyche following the bombs dropped in Japan to the blatant collusion of the U. S. Government against him and trying to discredit and blacklist him as a traitor after he spoke against the bomb. Christopher Nolan has solidified himself as a generational talent in directing, storytelling and imagery with this polarizing and operatic film."

Oppie doesn't regain his security clearance but gets decorated, which makes his wife happy. In a sideline to the story several hundreds of thousands of civilians get killed by the bomb Oppie developed, which costs him (Oppie) at least a few nights of good sleep, earning him the title of crybaby by Harry S.

Robert Oppenheimer is indeed ""become Death, destroyer of worlds"" as the Sanskrit passage goes -- was said to be the most devastating and humbling experience you'll ever have in a theater, IMAX or otherwise.

",/review/rw9329121/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer is a masterpiece brilliantly directed by Nolan, with a breathtaking performance by Cillian Murphy. But it could have been better. Personally, I found that there were some unnecessary scenes (you will know which ones), and that the film missed more minutes of female performances (the movie is 99% male), especially having a wonderful actress as Emily Blunt, which Nolan gave her maybe 10 minutes tops in 3 hours (and 2 minutes speaking). The two main women who appear (both brilliant in real life): Kitty Oppenheimer (who was a biologist and a botanist) and Jean Tatlock (a psychiatrist) appear respectively as a hysterical drunken, and a pure object. And that's a pity. I also think that Nolan could have add some images about the Holocaust too (or, at least, of WWII, both very relevant to the movie). There are some annoying anachronisms: Germans in the 40s were no ""Nazis"", but ""Germans"" (the Germans were trying to build an atomic bomb, not the ""Nazis""; the USA was at war with Germany, not with the ""Nazis""; the allies were at war with Germany, Italy and Japan; period). All the quantum mechanics parts in the movie are truly fascinating; still, you don't learn anything, and that's a missed opportunity. As I mentioned, Cillian Murphy's performance is absolutely outstanding. Robert Downey Jr. Is surprisingly brilliant. The music of the film (Ludwig Goränsson -not Hans Zimmer this time) is absolutely gorgeous, and Nolan's imprint is everywhere. If you like Nolan, you will love this movie. 9/10."

It seems like a story, and I know it's based on a true story. It was very, very good. I thetic of the film was very old money, and I didn't know how to explain it, but it was very luxury in a way that I like it, and the science was like another story like it was very interesting, and the quantum physics and theories was very interesting, and how Oppenheimer was feeling guilty about his own doing, and everything makes sense and they just got the feeling that they got in interstellar that's all top five favorite movies of all time."

Music all the way through the film which at times made me struggle to hear what was being said. Also felt that some scenes would have played better without music. Due to what felt like a rush to complete so many strands of his life, I never felt connected or to understand the man. A great cast but a film I would not watch again. I was never bored but it just did not have any emotional impact which surprised me. I am not a fan of nolan's previous film Tenet either.

",/review/rw9305751/?ref_=tt_urv,"I had originally thought this was a flawless film but upon reflection, I changed my mind. It is a magnificient film, with a splendid cast. It makes the science interesting and understandable (which could not have been easy) and it doesn't avoid the provocative politics of the situation. My complaint is that the audience does not necessarily understand why Oppenheimer is so arrogant and so celebrated. The film opens by showing how insecure and troubled he was, and then jumps ahead to the Manhattan Project without showing how he came to be so admired and so impressed with himself. It also shows many contenious relationships he had, leaving one to wonder why the Project scientists supported him decades later despite their dismay over the use of the bombs. I would have liked just a bit more showing his intellectual growth in his earlier years as well as his management of the Project. (I supposed I should read the book.)"

This is a film you must see, regardless of whether or not you watch a lot of movies. See it on the biggest IMAX screen you can. It is as much an engrossing document of vital history as it is an unparalleled sensory experience. This film is of course about the invention of nuclear weaponry, and of course, you'll get up close and personal to a real detonation. But that's nowhere near the thrill behind Oppenheimer. In fact, there isn't supposed to be one. Oppenheimer is a blistering indictment of the bomb's creation and a passionate anti-war plea. What's more, is that this is a masterful character study about the man behind the bomb, and the agonizing regret he felt about creating it in the first place."
22 July 2023,10," Oppenheimer is a uniquely intriguing and infinitely compelling Cinematic Experience.
",/review/rw9206661/?ref_=tt_urv,"'Oppenheimer' is a uniquely intriguing cinematic experience. It feels strangely-miraculous the way Christopher Nolan was able to take-on such complicated and even controversial subject matter and transform it into an intensely absorbing narrative intricately spiced with spectacularly imaginative visuals. Based on the over 700 page award winning biography 'American Prometheus' by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (which I have read multiple times-over, since it's 2005 publication). The story of how J. Robert Oppenheimer led the Manhattan Project to create the first atomic bombs (before the Axis powers could ever figure it out), later valiantly attempting to limit the probabilities of world-wide Earth-shattering nuclear holocaust.... eventually having his intimate family-life and professional reputation severely disrupted and indelibly injured by the torrent of irrational McCarthyist paranoia sweeping the early 1950's - makes for fascinating material indeed but also an extremely daunting endeavor to capture coherently & compellingly on film due to the sheer complexity of subject matter along with the perplexingly enigmatic nature of the man along with the cruelly-chaotic circumstances of his times. It most definitely feels like only a Top-tier exceedingly gifted writer/Director like Christopher Nolan possessed the artistic vision and innovative resourcefulness to truly bring 'Oppenheimer' to cinematic 'Life' (another critical-factor being Christopher Nolan's inspired choices for matching the very finest actors to their 'perfect' spot-on roles)."

The editing and sound design played such pivotal roles in the film in adding layers of depth beyond even the script and dialogue. I never thought I'd see a movie that has quite literally no action whatsoever but never-the-less never a dull moment. Every scene is pertinent, every line explosive and powerful. Featuring one of the most star-studded casts I've ever seen (I recognized every actor in the movie) giving the performances of their lifetimes, I strongly suspect everyone from the director, editor, writer, composer to the majority of the cast will receive tons of well-deserved accolades for this feature.

I thought this would at least be a good telling of historical drama but as in Tenet, Nolan seems to have lost the ability to actually tell a meaningful story and cares more about his latest ideas for cinematic style than his need to actually build emotion. The movie does conclude powerfully but cheaply, in literally the last 10 seconds, but I can't forgive it for wasting 30 minutes of my life before that. I thought the movie was 3 star entertainment, an IMDB 6.7 until somewhere around that 2 hour 30 mark when I actually checked my watch -- something I haven't done in any movie whatsoever -- in who knows how long. Why was this 3 hours long? Why was this offered in IMAX? Not only wasting 30-45 minutes more than necessary but more of my money as well. And why does one of the most powerful directors of my time need to rely on inserting 10 seconds of doom to create an impression at the end of his movie instead of actually building a story with a meaningful plot (to the movie, not to history).

The performances from the whole cast is outstanding every actor and actress deserves an Oscar. Especially Cilian Murphy as Oppenheimer, he is so and committed to the role. Another stand out performance is Robert Downey Junior, it shows that he's not just iron man. The dialogue is so gripping and you feel so invested in the story that is being told. The scene when they actually detonate the bomb was spectacular. The way the film ends leaves you walking out scared of the world we live in."

",/review/rw9215551/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is one of the biggest Nolan film I've ever seen since Batman begins , dark knight and dark knight rises, inception, Dunkirk and interstellar. Oppenheimer was absolutely well done and seeing Oppenheimer make the atomic bomb and asking Albert Einstein for advice on how the world will see how atomic bombs will impact wars and peoples lives . Nolan did a fantastic job getting the best people for universal Oppenheimer. Emily blunt Matt Damon , Robert Downey Jr Florence Pugh known for her role in Blackwidow was so outstanding playing the old love flame Oppenheimer really nailed it. But I wasn't surprised when she did the romance scenes will Cillian. But I'm very proud of her acting . Cillian Murphy was the perfect man for Oppenheimer. He captured the man very well I hope he plays another scientist in the next Nolan movie . It's been 18 15 to 11 years since he played scarecrow since the batman saga . But I never knew Oppenheimer was a ladies man which Im very very amazed and surprised. Nolan hasn't done anything like this since the 2000s or 2010s . But he deserves the credit for directing Oppenheimer which has changed Nolan's filming career . He hasn't done a 3hr movie like this . When peter Jackson directed lord of the rings saga the hobbit , King Kong were 3hr long movies which I'm used to watching. The filming in New Mexico perfect place film . Atomic bomb was very very amazing to see. But the explosions were absolutely awesome and very real to my eyes . The effects were so outstanding no cgi this time . When the atomic bomb went off It felt like I was gonna fly out . But I have to say I was so amazed of all the incredible work Nolan did . The filming was absolutely incredible. It was like traveling back in time . The black and white was so well done and very well documented. Nolan did a fantastic job following the stories of the year when ww2 was happening, and the whole world facing many changes and Oppenheimer trying to became the next man to outdo manhood god . When I see Oppenheimer the second time I'll see it on a bigger screen in imax with my cousin in Burbank and Santa Barbara with my dad . I hope to see the cast at the Santa Barbara film festival and I tell them you were absolutely fantastic in the movie. I hope to see Nolan , Cillian, Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon , and the entire cast at the Santa Barbara film festival ."

Christopher Nolan's latest and greatest masterwork is a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance. Achieving a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavour and ambition. The tour-de-force performances are matched only by its ear-blistering musical soundscape by Ludwig Göransson, Oppenheimer is a destructive force to be reckoned with, although I'm still peeved Universal didn't let Nolan detonate an actual nuclear bomb for Trinty."

",/review/rw9214635/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan's movies are among the best ever made, be it his Dark Knight Trilogy, gritty and trope-challenging crime operas that happen to have superheroes in them, or his science-fiction movies like Inception and Interstellar, which are though-provoking, yet still with the required amusement factor for the blockbuster audience. His last sci-fi movie, Tenet, was as high concept as ever, but also complex to a fault, and somewhat lacking a heart to win over the big crowds. But even though every movie that Nolan makes is big, he tends to alternate between something more mainstream (for lack of a better term) and something that feels a bit smaller and more personal. And though it tackles big themes, few of his movies feel so personal as Oppenheimer."

I have seen every single Nolan film, but they way he sees his films layered out is far different then other filmmakers of this generation. Oppenheimer is a brilliant piece of cinema directed by brilliant Christopher Nolan about a brilliant man named Oppenheimer. Yet the realization of the creation of this bomb made me feel scared. Oppenheimer will now not only be known as the man who created the atomic bomb, but the one who is will end the world as we know it. True masterpiece."

",/review/rw9204455/?ref_=tt_urv,Nolan's best?
21 July 2023,9," One of the best films of 2023
",/review/rw9203635/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer is the first film to come from Christopher Nolan's new journey in filmmaking by switching it up a bit to make probably one of the best biopics in the past decade. The story follows J. Robert Oppenheimer on a mission to help develop the atomic bomb that will affect the world as we know it, while also showing us the political dilemma that is caused by it, as well as the affect it has on himself and others close to him. Cillian Murphy as the title character J. Robert Oppenheimer gives probably the best performance of his career as well as one of the best performances of the year and I'm glad that Christopher Nolan finally gives him his time to shine after taking a backseat in Nolan's previous films throughout the years. Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer I thought fit her role well, although I wished we could of explored her character a bit more. Matt Damon as General Leslie Grooves Jr is a great addition to the supporting cast and is one of the best characters of the movie. Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss absolutely nails his role and also gives a great supporting performance in this film. Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock was also great, although I felt her role in the film was to be more absurd with Oppenheimer rather than supporting of him like I thought her character would be and I figured her character would of played a bigger role than what was anticipated, but overall, she was fantastic as always. The score for this film is probably one of the best scores I've heard since Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008) and the actual atomic bomb scene was incredible to watch. I also like how Christopher Nolan was able to give audiences insight and show how dangerous a atomic bomb can be and the affect it has on people. If there's any cons I have, the way sexuality/nudity is handled is a bit strange, but also I can see why it's handled that way and the third act starts to drag a bit, but other than that, there's not really much to complain about. Overall, Oppenheimer is not only probably one of the best films of 2023, but also one of the best biopics in the last decade that will be revisited for years to come."

It showed showed a very real and what felt like very true side to a life alter event that happened in your history and you could feel every bit of that impact in the audience as these decisions were being made. The acting was great for all characters and the ability to give what felt like back stage passes to one of the biggest events in the past century was amazing.

From a shuddering score by Ludwig Göransson, to the distinctively believable cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, the rattling sound design, the massive and completely grounded cast, and most importantly a story that speaks for itself with the emotions that overwhelm you as you leave the theater. Christopher Nolan never underestimates the intelligence and grasp that humans have while watching his films and he follows that same pattern in his 12th installment by introducing details that seem ambiguous at a first glance until they slowly formulate the defining moments to conclude this film. Cillian Murphy is disciplined in every mannerism that he physically expresses along with every bit of anxiety that he attempts to keep in. Another chapter to mark a defining moment in Nolan's career and hopefully one that will receive its worthy credit."

3 August 2023,7," Great acting, boring lengthy story.............
",/review/rw9235632/?ref_=tt_urv,"Let's be clear about this, the film is NOT about the story of the race to build the first nuke. There is NOTHING here about the Axis effort to build the bomb. This film is just about Oppenheimer, and it's not even a biopic in the true sense, it's just the story of HIS effort to build the bomb, with the assistance of a group of mostly Jewish scientists. Murphy is completely superb in the role, he IS Oppenheimer! This is one of the best acting performances I've ever seen and if Murphy doesn't pick up an Oscar then this world is mad. The storyline itself gets wrapped up in Oppenheimer's personal life and his later struggles to avoid being labelled as a communist and a security risk. There is little about Oppenheimer's early life and his family background; you are often made to feel that he was some kind of heroic figure when in truth he was a very flawed human being. There is even a scene when Oppenheimer's wife worries about him losing his job and their nice home - total BS because Oppenheimer was a rich man independently of his job. He inherited the equivalent of $4M in today's money when his father died early on in Oppenheimer's life and certainly would not have worried about losing his job. His job was a hobby, an obsessive hobby that he was brilliant at , but a hobby all the same - he did not need it to survive. The investigation story later on in the film was boring and lengthy, stretching out the film at least half an hour more than needed. It's necessary to call out Robert Downey Jr as Oppenheimer's FBI nemesis, Lewis Strauss, for a brilliant acting performance, and credit also needs to go to Benny Safdie as Edward Teller and David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi, both of whom were excellent. The bit parts played by Branagh, Conti and Oldman were, predictably, executed superbly by these masterful actors. The female cast was a disappointment, but then they didn't have much material to get their teeth into, so hardly surprising. Overall I give this film 7 out of 10 for the great acting, but the storyline was poorly handled by Nolan, not one of my favourite directors. Lastly, the very loud sounds and music (if you call it that) during the film ruined much of the enjoyment."

25 July 2023,10," A true cinematic event with the most unnerving onscreen explosion ever
",/review/rw9214322/?ref_=tt_urv,"I don't really know how to describe a cinematic experience but I think Oppenheimer should be counted as one. You are absorbed into the story, and feel immersed into this world. The movie plays like a thriller slowly revealing new details. Nolan is a master of playing the story non-linearly, but the use of colors contrasting with black and white clearly distinguishes the timeline. We see the lead up to the building of the atomic bomb, and the aftermath. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is just killing it (pun intended), needless to say. I see there is a solid casting and every supporting actor grabs your attention. Even Florence Pugh's small role in the movie is interesting. Emily Blunt's talent is not wasted even with the little screen time she is given. I can say every sensory experience you can get from a movie is fully exploited. The use of sound is very much part of the story, and keeps you feeling anxious throughout. You also feel Cillian's Oppenheimer. I mean Nolan literally bares his character just to show his state of mind and emotion. This is done in various scenes. I could feel the shock Oppenheimer felt when he was cheered on by crowds after learning of the deaths caused by his invention. Whatever emotional journey Oppenheimer is experiencing, I could feel it. I also like how the science is explained simply, and I could grasp the idea of how an atomic bomb works. It was great to see what physicists I had only heard of in name on screen such as Niels Borh, Heisenberg, and most importantly Einstein. It was like the Avengers of geeks, and three hours did not feel long. Robert Downey Jr was brilliant as Lewis Strauss, and I see he channeled a bit of Tony Stark too, but in the unlikable side. Matt Damon was great too, and I like his back and forth with Cillian Murphy. The best part is the explosion scene, and that is worth the wait. I could say they could have ended the movie shortly after the explosion though. Yet, the explosion scene was perfectly executed. It was tense, and showcases the most powerful and unnerving atomic explosion scene in cinema. Nolan perfectly shows how dangerous an atomic bomb is without showing any death, and the impact of it lingers even as the story continues after the explosion. I certainly believe that Oppenheimer will be one of the most important movies of the decade if not of all time. I may even watch it again on the big screen, and yes you do need to watch it on the big screen to fully enjoy it."

",/review/rw9219012/?ref_=tt_urv,"If you wish to argue in favour of Christopher Nolan being one of the visionary filmmakers of this era with a bunch of people, take them to an IMAX screening of Oppenheimer. After the sci-fi overdose that was Tenet, Nolan chooses to tell the story of the theoretical physicist whose name has nearly become synonymous with the atomic bomb. This is a man who had ambitions of epic proportions, and he had his distinct ways of getting there. The film takes you through significant events in the life of the titular protagonist, told in a non-linear style. It's almost like two parts of a single story running into each other from opposite directions (like a chemical reaction), eventually converging at a pivotal confrontation scene featuring Robert J Oppenheimer, Lewis Strauss, and Albert Einstein. This particular scene carries so much emotional heft when it unfurls at the very end, even when we get to see it play out from another angle early on. And that's just one of many such incredible instances of fantastic storytelling we see in the film!"

Also prepare for a Titanic-style treasure trove of Oscars come award season. Cillian already has one hand on his statue, while Nolan will surely take home Best Film and Director. Downey might also sneak a Best Supporting. But the true master here is Ludwig Goransson, whose score ensures the exposition is never boring, amping up the tension to unbearable levels of dread. Couldn't believe it wasn't Hans Zimmer when I looked it up. Add the unbelievable sound mix and Oppenheimer is terrifyingly unsettling. It has all the hallmarks of classic docudramas like JFK and 13 Days, with MTV editing and time jumps, but is a superior film that must be seen on a big screen, preferably IMAX. Awesome 10/10."

It is a symphony of powerful performances (Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is brilliant, and his name had better be in many award season nominations), Emily Blunt and Matt Damon were amazing and Christopher Nolan weaved a profound film that went beneath J.

Christopher Nolan grand biographical, as we all know is about the genius of the same name, and who was instrumental in creating the first nuclear weapons. The film is all about Oppenheimer leading the Manhattan Project under General Groves and in collaboration with a number of great scientists, physicists and others. We might have read/ watched a lot about the bombing of Hiroshima/ Nagasaki, but not many are aware about Oppenheimer's credit and what followed aftermath. Christopher Nolan is a legend of modern-day cinema, and this film only cements his reputation further. He took the basic story of a genius, but layered it with his humane side, his weaknesses, his inner voice in backdrop of world at war, communism, and modern history. The film has parallel tracks of the past and present and they create magic on screen. The enquiry scenes are intriguing and the actual testing scenes are thrilling. The film has great performances, and Cillian Murphy walks tall in the title role. It also has great cameos of other great scientists/physicists/professors of that era-Niels Bohr, Edward teller but it is the scenes featuring Albert Einstein which leaves maximum impact. An awesome film in all departments of storytelling and technicalities, this one is one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in recent years, wherein more focus had been on Marvel kind cinema. The film is heavy on dialogues and uses lot of technical and political terms so is a serious watch without light scenes. Inspite of that and the complex topic if people from all over are loving the film, then it is triumph of Nolan, the team and Oppenheimer himself!"

At first glance, the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer would appear to be a tough sell to modern audiences used to the super heroics of the MCU and the DCEU, or franchises like JOHN WICK, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, but Nolan pulls it off not by pandering to the so-called ""modern audience,"" but instead treating them like adults and giving them a cinematic experience which rewards patience and investment."

Some scenes like what was mentioned repeat or become redundant throughout the film. The film focused too much on Oppenheimer's politics and not enough on the man himself.

All of this said, I was absolutely captivated the entire time.

",/review/rw9208262/?ref_=tt_urv,"With his affinity for mind-bending, time-bending action spectacle blending brains and brawn, Christopher Nolan's blockbusters have a dedicated following among cinephiles. For Nolan, no amount of practical affects is too ambitious, no amount of IMAX cameras. I've always been a huge Nolan fan, and while it may sound a bit cliché to say this, films like ""The Dark Knight,"" ""The Prestige,"" and ""Inception"" have had a formidable effect on my understanding of film. They taught me how audience expectations from blockbusters can be subverted by a formidable auteur, how action sequences can be combined with a cerebral narrative that conceptually integrates intellectual concepts as the backbone of the storytelling, and how to expect the unexpected from original and creative storytelling. Nolan's new film, ""Oppenheimer,"" may sound a bit more conventional and by-the-numbers than some of his other films, but viewers should rest assured that he has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to keep viewers engaged and thrilled. It is a completely riveting and extraordinarily well-made work that, in my opinion, is Nolan's best film."

I was expecting more dissection of the psyche of the people were affected by the bombs going off. You really only see it from one point of view - Oppenheimer's. And like okay we get it, he had major regrets about being involved. But who cares? I would've loved to see more from the victims point of view or the towns and cities affected. It was only okay and honestly expected more from a brilliant film maker like Nolan. Honestly I'm sure my opinion on the film is highly affected by the CRAZY STUPID HYPE surrounding this film.

Don't believe all those mocking reviews which say you need to know physics for this, absolutely not. Basic knowledge of science is enough and you get the context of stuff going on but yes you need to pay attention. Don't put your mind on those free refill popcorns and drinks.

How Oppenheimer varies from Tenet, and why it's a better film, has something to do with the acting. Cillian Murphy embodies Oppenheimer to the degree that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role, and he's buttressed by an impressive ensemble cast including Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr (what might have been...had he not devoted the best years of his life to Marvel), and many others who will certainly look familiar, meriting a visit to the Wikipedia cast list.

And given this, so is missing a thorough character development of the protagonist. In the end, we know he succeeded yet cannot pinpoint just how that happened: we know that Groves, aptly played by Damon, was outrageously difficult for a scientist to deal with. The IMAX format was not necessary as the visuals/sets don't get a boost from it. It just has no grand visual elements. But the story and subject matter held my attention. Blunder: I was sorry to (not) see a proper epilogue noting the very recent posthumous reinstatement of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Costuming was poor: 1940s men always wore hats and shirts that were (only) white. Aside from hairstyles (and period autos) the piece felt too modern. Truman's Whitehouse was quite authentic.

It does not carry the same weight as the mental and emotional struggle to build the bomb. Nolan beats us senseless in the last third by having these long, boring sessions where Oppenheimer and his witness are verbally assaulted during his security hearing. Who cares? 226,000 people were killed by the bomb and the scenes afterwards have to do with his security clearance and accusations of communist sympathies? Yeah, ok, that's important to Oppenheimer but I was praying for it to end quickly. Nolan went off the rails at the end. That last third was just ok. Could have cut a lot of repetitive information that just doesn't mean squat."

Obviously, all the performances were absolutely incredible, especially from Cillian Murphy, R. D. J, and Emily Blunt. Oppenheimer takes even mundane scenes to the most tense possibility. You'll probably feel the same in the seconds leading up to the Trinity test as you feel watching Cillian Murphy sit in a chair in the background while everyone else talks, it's that tense. It's also incredibly melancholic, the movie ends where you expect it to but the revelations and connections back to the beginning are perfectly executed. Oppenheimer was an incredibly complex individual and while the movie does want you to root for him it also showcases many of his shortcomings throughout his life. The Trinity test itself is beautiful in an eerie way and what follows is even more interesting. The dialogue is spot on and the sound mixing is insanely well done which is a big step up from Nolan's other movies. Definitely a must-see in IMAX. Almost perfect except for the sex scenes, especially the one during the interview, which were so out of place and made my whole theater uncomfortable. (9/10)"

Runtime clocks in at 3 hours but it went by very smoothly because there is so much going on. For those wondering, yes you can just dive right in. There's nothing you need to watch to understand what is going on. In fact, other than my time in school the only other times I've heard of any of the scientists in this movie were from the times they were mentioned on the popular tv sitcom The Big Bang Theory. Nolan is one of my favorite directors. His storytelling style may not be for everyone. So far I've loved each of his movies. Nolan joins a very short list of Directors that I don't need a bunch of anything to get me to watch their next story. Nolan has a very unique way in how he presents to you his stories. This one is no different. This movie is shot beautifully, and the practical set in Los Alamos really brought the scenes to life. It is amazing that Nolan was able to do all of this with the use of practical effects and little to no CGI. Let's talk about the music. The music adds elements of horror and intensity throughout. As a matter of fact, throughout the movie my Apple Watch kept going off because my heart rate had spiked high. That's how intense certain scenes got. Every actor in this movie brought their A game. There was such a great balance between all of them. I did like how a little bit of the movie felt like Seven Samurai and this is shown in the Trailer where Oppenheimer and General Groves go out and start recruiting scientists for this amazing, impossible task. I saw this movie in Dolby. Last time Nolan had a movie out I watched it in every format because I couldn't get enough and Oppenheimer is going to be no different.

From there in the film develops into the biographical tale of Oppenheimer's progress from theorist to professor to manager of one of the most life changing science projects in history. Now, Opp isn't a nice guy. He cheats on his wives, he drops his friends in with the rabid Commie hunters in the US at the time, and he doesn't appear to have any outwardly regrets at what he has helped create. Nolan has the, brilliant, Murphy, internalising his ""pain"", but it's all rather meh. There is a long drawn out trial, but not a trial, intended to discredit Oppie. And it's never clear that it actually does. Robert Downey Jr is portrayed as a snidey turncoat for apparently being belittled by Oppie. Yeah, okay. What the audience was really being built up for was the nuclear testing. The real drama. Can the Atom Boys build it in time!!! (I'm not going to spoil this bit). So we get to the testing, in full 70mm and sensurround, Dino vision and double Dolby. And... It's a bit of a let down in I'm honest. We see an explosion. In quite a bit of darkness. That's it. Now this may well reflect what happened. But this is the movies. Nolan could have used some artistic licence to enhance the viewing experience. And after that there is an inexorable meander towards the frankly bland ending. It's well made, really well acted, in particular by Murphy and RDJ, but it could have had 45 minutes of it edited down to a less bum numbing run time and there could have been a bit more sciencey bits on relation to the bomb. Would have been a much better experience as a 3 part TV mini series. Don't hate me."

",/review/rw9212193/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer: The Manhattan Project is central to this film but it is also about how Oppenheimer's intellectual development, his life and loves. Cillian Murphy is devastating in his portrayal of the great scientist whose mind was wracked with strange thoughts of the stars and of the Quantum World, a womaniser, drinker, chain smoker. Great luminaries like Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), Nils Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and Einstein (Tom Conti) have walk on parts or cameos. The Einstein cameo proves to be central to the films narrative though. The film unfolds through two hearing and Oppenheimer's career progression on to being Director of the Manhattan Project. The hearing on Oppenheimer's security clearance in 1954 shows how he was deserted by many friends and colleagues but also uncovers the Iago behind this assault on his integrity. In ways Oppenheimer was his own worst enemy, careless in his choice of friends and too quick to make enemies. There are too many characters to cover in any one review but Emily Blunt puts in a creditable performance as Kitty Oppenheimer, having to hold things together, putting her life as a botanist on hold. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) stood by Oppenheimer in 1954 but their relationship is portrayed as being stormy during the Los Alamos years, fights over security clearances for other scientists and even Oppenheimer himself due to past political associations. We even get to see Oppenheimer's involvement in unionising scientists. Even though we know the outcome the tension builds as the Trinity Test approaches. Fermi (Danny Deferrari) makes book on how may kilotonnes the explosion will be with a side bet on the atmosphere igniting. A tale of victory, betrayal but also of how scientists had differing opinions on the use of atomic weapons and the post war use of atomic energy. The two hearings head towards a conclusion just as the Manhattan Project does, all three resulting in different levels of destruction. Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 9/10."

The book though only spends a brief time reviewing his work at Los Alamos and virtually nothing of his scientific work.

The rest of the cast is great too, Robert Downey Jr. Is such a talented actor since he is Iron Man and I've only seen the first Sherlock Holmes movie but I'll watch A Game of Shadows before the third one arrives (If it comes out). Along with brilliant performances by Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt (who used an American accent which was weird cuz she's British IRL), Oscar winners; Rami Malek & Gary Oldman (who I didn't recognize while watching it). It was 3 hours long, I was careful not to drink too much water (just like Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One), I fell asleep in bits of it and I stayed awake for the rest of it which was funny!

",/review/rw9261936/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan is a difficult guy to work with. He is a principled filmmaker, despises 3D and avoids CGI as much as possible. Yet his movies are anything but traditional. Throughout his career, he showed an exceptionally masochistic pleasure in challenging himself with complex and ambitious scripts--sometimes too complex and ambitious for his own good. In a way, he is like the title character of his latest biopic ""Oppenheimer"". I feel like if he and the man himself would have met each other they'd be good friends."

Horribly boring film with no action, only people talking and talking about really uninteresting things.

But to begin with, this is not a typical Christopher Nolan movie. His earlier movies were more into visual appeals and how he captured the panoramic and action sequences. Such scenes allow the director to experiment and come up with breathtaking scenes for the visual hunger of the audience which worked in Nolan's flavor, although, although, here comes the mastery of his work, as the movie Oppenheimer was not his typical action, thriller, adventure genre of movie where he could use his already hit templates, rather this was a plain biographical movie and his usual hit template had no use in it. The movie demanded something else, which was never Nolan's forte or maybe we weren't shown as such, with Oppenheimer Nolan showcases what he is capable of, which is, he is capable of pulling up a thriller cinematic experience out of a rather normal biographical movie on life of a physicist. He did not use any of his previous templates but rather focussed mainly on the dissection of the character of not just Oppenheimer but also people involved in his life. The colours of the characters one by one appeared in front of you just as layers of onion appear and the final colours of the characters when juxtaposed made the movie come out in flying colours. This was a rather perfect example of how direction and storytelling can engross the audience so much in a movie as if you are living someone else's life. This 3-hour movie was a piece of artwork and for me is the piece de resistant of Christopher Nolan."

The theme of annihilation associated with the nuclear arms race still resonate today. The only issue was the running time of 3 hours. I felt the film could have been just as effective if it shaved off about 45 minutes. There is a lot of time devoted to a hearing to determine whether Oppenheimer gets to retain his security clearance. This may be an effective way to tell a story but the stakes of the ""trial"" never felt that high. Similarly there is confirmation hearing for the Secretary of Commerce played by Robert Downey Jr. That is simply not very interesting when compared to the high stakes development and testing of the nuclear bomb."

",/review/rw9294914/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan narrates in this drama the rise and fall of the physicist Robert Oppenheimer, author of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is a good movie with an interesting story about this physicist who rose to fame for creating a powerful destructive weapon, but after taking several lives it left him with a feeling of remorse that haunted him for the rest of his life. It is a well written and directed movie with acceptable performances. Of course, due to the 3 hours duration and the amount of dialogues it has, it can be heavy. The entire film recounts the process of creating the bomb during World War II and how Oppenheimer later had to deal with serious charges and incriminations after opposing the use of his discovery for military purposes. It is a story of a man who discovered something powerful, but in the wrong hands it could be dangerous to many human lives. In many respects it is a tragic story of a prodigious genius who was cursed by his discovery. Oppenheimer is a fascinating historical film about the mind behind one of the most catastrophic events in human history and how this brilliant mind was doomed by it. My final rating for this movie is 9/10."

The public is very well aware of the consequences of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima but what went behind the doors, the bureaucracy and the challenges it faced was unclear until I saw this movie. I'm not saying everything in the film was factually correct but it painted an important lesson that the atomic bomb is not something to play with. The audience is too busy criticizing the naked body of Florence or the cinematic performances of the film, they are missing out on the actual point the film is trying to deliver which is that the scientists did not live their lives celebrating the death of thousands but rather spent their lives trying to correct the wrongs, trying to keep the dangerous weapon from being played on the field ever again. The line ""They wont fear it until they understand it. They wont understand it until they've used it"" - sums up the entire film and the logic behind the decision. Oppenheimer was a genius but also a complicated man but how could you not be when you possess such intelligence - the film also did a fantastic job on illustrating this."

At times it reminded me of the recurrent joke in ""The Big Bang Theory"" about Howard not being a real scientist since he ""only"" holds a PhD in Engineering. I was a bit disappointed with the sound but it might be an artistic choice. Do words, does dialogue really matter when you are retelling how the fear of violence from one side pushed the other to unleash the most deadly and brutal attack on Japan. This is a well written movie though the ending is disappointingly cliche for a Nolan screenplay. Around the two hour mark. It felt like it was getting boring. It might benefit from some cuts.

And I concur it is a brilliant move on those fronts though a tad too long and heavy in lengthy dialogues in early stages.. However for me the move is incredibly important for bringing to the fore a turning point in the modern human civilization. Ability of humankind to destroy itself without needing any interstellar objects is a haunting prospect and this could be via nuclear weapons or via a more contemporary advances in AI.. The youth and future generations would be well served by watching this movie and being awakened to the destructive possibilities. In 1945, there was arguably a greater horror in the form of Hitler and fascists. Today there are horrors and evil forces but none that pervasive and so we are better served to unite in the thinking and philosophy towards the development and use of weapons of mass destruction.. Before I close off, I am a big fan of Cillian Murphy since Peaky Blinders and there is no better person to have essayed this fascinating character and genius.

The movie introduces numerous characters and presents a ton of historical information at breakneck speed, making it challenging to grasp everything in one go.

For me, films like Dunkirk and Tenet come off as cold nd lifeless, more interested in intricate film making than telling a compelling story. Nolan seems to actively want to alienate the audience with these movies. Interestellar and The Dark Knight Rises, on the other hand, almost feel too sentimental, betraying Nolan's characteristic fixation on logical storytelling for endings that seem like studio encouraged ""feel good"" endings that aren't necessarily earned."

I'd be surprised if his latest flawless role execution didn't land him an Oscar, or at least a nomination for one. What perhaps might work against it, would be the enduring sensitivities surrounding the use of the atomic bomb and the vital role that Oppenheimer played in its development. But, his country asked him to do something and he did it brilliantly. He was a brilliant scientist after all, and in the world we don't only have scientists but we also have politicians.

The biographical docu-drama brings to the screen the life story of the scientist who led the Manhattan Project and raises questions relevant then and relevant today about the responsibilities of scientists and the risks of research and technological achievements put at the service of militaries and governments. The cast features an impressive gallery of Hollywood stars, and the special effects sprinkled throughout the film give it an extra dimension of appeal (and a Nolan touch).

At 3 hours in length, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea - I realized halfway through I wished we had gone to a theatre with reclining chairs.

The first sex scene was as expected, slightly awkward almost like the first time you lose your virginity. In the book, Oppenheimer, experienced abusive pressure from his mother in who he should date. The first sex scene is them barley nude with her in-control and dominating him. The later is them both equally comfortable and fully exposed to their core with each other. Like the bomb he's building...they're drawn together, attracted to each other, and when connected sensational things happen, but they're destructive to each other and to those around them. The fact we're still talking about it, proves it was a psychologically effective visual of seeing Oppenheimer and his mistress both on top of each other in that hearing room with Emily Blunt staring directly into her eyes.

This movie is not just important to understand what's an atomic bomb or how much it cost to build one,it is about how much it cost to be a human and how much it cost to make hard decisions. In this movie we see the life of a brilliant and genius man and how he struggles to make decisions like a normal human. We see imperfections in every character and this is what Nolan wanted,not making a good character or a bad one(No villian and no hero). I gave it 9 stars beacuse i think the explosion in the second act of the film wasn't that great like Nolan said it will be but like i said, this movie is not about the bomb or explosion,it's about characters."

Cillian Murphy nailed the titular role without any doubt he is the finest actors of our generation you can see the emotions he shows on screen just by his face and that's how i can say that Christopher Nolan nailed the casting of this movie.. RDJ, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh all are perfectly cast in their roles of these real life persons who changed the course of our history.. RDJ is not just some comedic actor who played Iron Man in MCU but he is also one of the finest actors ever and you can feel this just by seeing his performance in this movie...Tom Conti also shines as legendry Albert Einstein in this movie even though his role of small... Christopher Nolan is able to deliver a masterpiece again in name of this movie which will be remembered for a very long time in future, without any doubt Oppenheimer will become a Classic in future since it's on of the greatest movies ever made...
Screenplay, Music, Cinematography, Pacing everything is just perfect.. If you know just even basic Science like Nuclear fission and fusion, division of atoms, electrons, hydrogen etc you'll love thus movie even more since you can easily understand what is shown on screen..

I resigned myself to letting Chris Nolan be Chris. Cillian Murphy encompasses the weird manner that Oppenheimer put out there. And Emily Blunt is powerful as Kitty Oppenheimer. But the movie's fulcrum starts to shift to Robert Downey Jr's performance is Lewis Strauss, whose relationship with Oppenheimer changes the course of our collective history in a way that translates into the original cancel culture of the 50s where anyone who didn't toe the line was treated as a traitor."

This isn't a war movie and there's barely any elements of action, suspense, or thriller in this. This is history and autobiography from a cinematic and dramatic point of view. You go in there just to focus on the dialogue and the acting performance going on because that's what it's all about in this movie. It's basically two stories of Oppenheimer -
1) His involvement in developing the A Bomb
2) The suspicion of him being a Communist."
24 July 2023,9," Simply Outstanding
",/review/rw9212057/?ref_=tt_urv,"Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that's precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan's three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist's life, chronicles his development of ""the gadget"" and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer's odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture's production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering's outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. ""Oppenheimer"" is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder."

If you want go see iMax screens of people's faces arguing who's a communist and who's not this movie is for you, if you were expecting something like Interstellar I apologize. On the other hand if you ignore what I said and can enjoy the acting and cinematography then by all means go for it. This can still be a great movie, I just went in with very wrong expectations."

",/review/rw9208908/?ref_=tt_urv,"Barbenheimer is deemed this year's biggest cinematic event, and the two distinct films have both exceeded my personal expectations. More than I hoped for- Oppenheimer is a gripping, intense psychological drama. While not for the faint of heart and sometimes hard to watch, it is sure a film that is to change our modern cinematic Hollywood landscape. Oppenheimer's striking, unique filmmaking techniques, effects, and cinematography leaves viewers in awe or shock while truthfully aiding in the storytelling. Although the storytelling and structure is non-linear, I found it not too difficult to follow along to and carefully and cleverly crafted. The sound design of the film is phenomenal and sometimes unexpected (in a remarkably sensational way that shifts perspectives of events). Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack was absolutely essentially to the dramatization of the story and events. The stellar screenplay and performances truly shined through Nolan's insane direction of the film. Although the first act felt a bit slow at times, I was blown away by the film at the end and was left wanting more, hoping it would not end. Oppenheimer revealed more depth than I imagined by exploring the leading character's moral dilemmas and the effects of the political landscape at the time. While not necessarily for all ages or types of audiences, Oppenheimer is fresh, absorbing, notable, and must be seen in the theaters on the big screen."

But it would have been better a 2 hour linear docudrama, than a 3 hour mysterious storytelling adventure where the director keeps us in his thrall with his cutting, and his use of color to depict time. The science, which is actually the most important character in the story, is almost totally excluded. The scenes meant to describe fission processes, were not related to fission at all. Dark stars aren't relevant. Neither is the physics of how stars work, because stars work by fusion, and this is a story about fission. The atomic bomb was inevitable, given the continuing discoveries by nuclear physicists. A few years There was a time, shortly before the Manhattan project was funded, the we didn't know if it could work, theoretically. But that wasn't made a part of the Oppenheimer story.

However, it turned out to be more of a political drama discussing Oppenheimer's political views and his clashes with bureaucrats. I was wrong to believe it was about the exciting story of Manhattan project. Although some people said this is a movie made to save cinemas from streaming services (like Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible - which is definitely a movie made for cinemas), I do not think you should necessarily go to the cinema to enjoy it.

Did you know that he ate only one almond and water for weeks to lose the weight? I worry about actors who do stuff like that - many doctors think it is dangerous. His performance is excellent, I am sure that an Oscar nomination will be forthcoming. But the highlight for me in acting was Robert Downey, Jr. As Lewis Strauss, the former head of the Atomic Energy Commision who developed a deep hatred for Oppenheimer on a perceived slight at a hearing. And he was suspicious of Oppenheimer communist ties - he teamed up with Edward Teller, who was angry with Oppenheimer because of Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-bomb to wreck Oppenheimer's professional life. At least so far this year, I think Downey is a shoo-in for a best supporting actor Oscar. The movie is filled with many other fine actors, including Rami Malek (""Mr. Robot"") who has a relatively small but key role in the hearings on Strauss. Emily Blunt is very good as Oppenheimer's wife but the highlight from the female acting performance for me is Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock. My only casting complaint is Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves; Groves was a beefy, gruff man, I don't think Damon fills that bill - the late, great Brian Dennehy would have been perfect. Surely there is a similar actor out there. The movie is filled with half of Hollywood it seems, including Alden Ehrenreich, Dane DeHaan, and Josh Hartnett.

I did not feel bored or look at the clock at all. The acting was very beautiful and also, for sure, the directing was very great. The dialogues that were present throughout the film were beautiful and had a strong meaning and presence in the story. It is not present in vain. I expect that I will watch it in the cinema more than once during this period. It is one of the most beautiful works that I have seen during the past two years and deservedly deserves the Oscar in many aspects."

The first time, I was a couple of minutes late, and even after reaching, settling and relaxing made the first scene that register in my mind, the apple scene which kind of completely shifted my perception and made me judge the movie differently. This time the proper opening really changed that. I knew how technically brilliant this was from the first watch but this time the emotional rapport was also perfect for me. Oppenheimer is the kind of flawed hero Nolan loves to portray. My qualms about what was chosen to show and what wasn't made much more sense this time. It was also great to see a biopic that didn't combine a lot of characters into one but instead used a plethora of great actors perfectly cast to each role, which can only be done by a director like Nolan because of his unique ""star-power"" as a director."

His conscience cannot live down the fact that his team's groundbreaking discovery has been employed to cause mass destruction (even under the pretext of stopping an ongoing war, why not send an ultimatum to forewarn the Japanese people and at least grant them the freedom to act according to what they choose to believe? A humane gesture a country could've offered to any of its enemies), but he is also immensely proud of this achievement."

The then 160 year old country which was founded with high moral values became the strongest of all countries thanks to the commitment of all its citizens always upholding right from wrong, good vs bad. Moral & immoral! Sadly this is not longer true. If today's society is challenged in the way it was back in the 40's we would become a chaotic mass of crybabies, finger pointing chickens blaming whoever is weak. Nolan sets up this giant explosive alarm clock which may and probably not awaken our souls drowned in consumerism while the rest of the world led by corrupt socialists succumbs to poverty.

He understands what good art mixed with good storytelling can achieve and I often criticize other movies for their lack of expression and daring because the predictable is the safe path.

The non-linear narrative may not work for everyone, but we all know this is how Nolan makes his films. Therefore, we need to be ready for it. The acting was top notch, although Emily Blunt deserved more screen time. Same for Florence Pugh, really. So, there's a lot of mansplaining in this film, so to speak. Maybe that's a reflection of the subject matter's eras, but in a modern world, it is very noticeable. It doesn't detract from the quality of the film, but perhaps it makes us think that the film could have been a lot better if done differently. Either way, highly recommend this film for informative, intellectual, and thought-provoking ideas about humanity and science. Probably a lot of lessons in here about AI, too, using the idea expressed in Jurassic Park: The scientists were so concerned with whether they could, they didn't think about whether they should."

You can hear him speak 'Dutch' for a class of students, but everyone in our Dutch movie theatre mumbled 'what? What's he saying?' It was a fantasy language, and certainly not Dutch, not even German. I think making a movie about real events requires proper investigation and love for details. Therefore we thought it was irritating that the actor and director didn't check this scene with Dutchies. The movie was very long and there were lots of characters and names you had to remember, but the general warning and impact of human destruction power and balances of power was very clear and very frightening. The uncertainty whether the bomb would destroy the complete atmosphere, and that they took that risk: man, one day we will really destroy earth, one way or the other."
2 September 2023,10," ""Oppenheimer"" offers a unique perspective on the human experience.""
",/review/rw9299265/?ref_=tt_urv,"Nolan's bio-pic, based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's Pulitzer-winning biography ""American Prometheus,"" follows the life of physicist and scientist Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer, a student in the 19th century, tours European science capitals before returning to the US and joining Caltech and Berkeley. At Berkeley, he becomes a union organizer and donates to the anti-Fascist cause during the Spanish Civil War. He hangs out with Communist Party members, including his brother Frank and Jackie's wife. Despite not being a Party member, Oppenheimer is spied on by the F. B. I. And meets a Communist medical student named Jean Tatlock, leading to an ill-fated relationship. In 1942, General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) appoints Oppenheimer to oversee the Army's nuclear bomb development program. Despite political suspicion, Groves supports Oppenheimer, who proves to be a master of both scientific and political aspects. However, the Red Scare and his proximity to Communists make him an easy target. Oppenheimer was stripped of his security clearance in 1954. The movie is structured as a mosaic, intercutting Oppenheimer's life from his rise to fall, connecting his early leftism and later pacifism with the McCarthy era. This fractured chronology makes the film less complex, as events are reduced to their function within a larger morality tale. Nolan's film cuts scenes together like a jigsaw puzzle, leaving out contradictions, subtleties, and random peculiarities, leaving a feeling of experience for both the protagonist and the viewer. The movie is a puzzle to be solved rather than lived. ""Oppenheimer"" explores the tension between physics and war, focusing on the character of Jewish and leftist researcher Oppenheimer. He is committed to creating an atomic bomb, believing Nazi Germany is ahead in developing one. However, after Germany surrenders in May 1945, work on the bomb accelerates, causing a moral crisis for Oppenheimer. This mission drift determines the rest of the film and his life. Oppenheimer's involvement in the Manhattan Project leaves him compromised, committed to creating a weapon of unparalleled destructiveness without any control over its use. The film ultimately explores the consequences of his actions during the war. ""Oppenheimer"" is a fascinating film that explores the complexities of individual and collective personality. Despite criticisms of its length, its fascinating physical experience is largely due to its exploration of themes such as Oppenheimer's sex life and Strauss's enmity. The film's focus on governmental hearings, including the third hour, is a testament to its entropic tendencies. The characters appear before a tribunal, bringing to account their contradictions, hypocrisies, and sins. The tribunal is hidden, allowing the audience to make their own decisions, a feature that is as expected of a film. Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" offers a unique perspective on the human experience. A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws."

",/review/rw9226327/?ref_=tt_urv,"A star-studded cast brings a very interesting although dialog heavy presentation of the trials of J Oppenheimef and his role in creating the automic bomb. The cast delivers stellar performances but the movie drags on partly because it is so thick in content and dialog, but also because as usual with a Nolan film, will likely require a second viewing to get all the nuances. Both it's strength and it's weakness, is the subject matter about the controversies surrounding the atomic boom: it will seem like an old rehash by many viewers, and like a fresh look to others. In either case, the acting and writing presents excellent and fresh content about the life and trials of Oppenheimer."

Nolan never lets this happen with astounding score, crackling dialogue , flawless acting and the typical Nolan direction. There is never a dull moment. Also there's a real element of suspense/ tension that Nolan exudes which makes this biopic feel more like a suspenseful drama but never swaying away from documenting the self titled life story. If the film had ended at the bombing I think I would have given this one less star but the last 40 minutes post bombing is riveting cinema and elevates it to almost greatness. Is this Nolan's best film? Not for me but is never the less a fantastic achievement."

Even, I was silent after the film. It was because, I didn't like the film much and the end credits made me think about the money that I spent to experience the film. I could've got grocery with it. People near me were occasionally snoring or playing with each other. Seeing the **x scene on that big screen made some near me breath heavily. Positives about the film would be Nolan's ability to execute the story in a fairly non-boring way, the awesome sound (maybe it's an IMAX effect), and an opportunity to see Cillian's craft in an up close manner. I liked his character in Peaky Blinders and in this you're able to see that he has put more work into it, from TV Screen to Big Screen requires that commitment and he has done it. A pro like Robert's acting was also relevant, however this kind of acting is nothing new to him. Emily's role seemed to be an overrated one, I don't know why they did it, maybe to show her in a special light, I don't know. I would like to see Cillian in a western-rancher kind of film, just to see how it would turn out."

An impressive production that - while wide in scale and covering a span of several decades, also manages to be an intimate biography of the man at its center - J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy). Nolan's screenplay (based on a book by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin) is divided into three basic movements, although the story freely bounces back and forth in time. Nolan further bisects the film into subjective vs. Objective viewpoints (signaled by Color and B&W photography, respectively)."

Robert Oppenheimer), so the type of film plot is not like Nolan's works in general.

The beginning of the movie was rather slow and way to much dialogue. After they started to preparate the bomb the movie became a bit more decent. The acting was really good nothing bad to say on that part but the movie itself wasn't it for me... Understandable if Murphy gets an Oscar for this movie since I can't think of any others at the moment to get it for a leader role, his acting was high class.

Something not action-pack, not computer generated, not fun or silly quips, but something new or refreshing that us audiences haven't seen in a long time. Even with Nolan's style of filmmaking, this movie feels different from the rest of his work. It's basically a 3-hour movie about J.

It's mostly people talking throughout the movie, but the main focus is Oppenheimer which is more of a character study in his point of view and Lewis Strauss. The cast was fantastic, it was visually stunning, the music score is very tense like you were a part of that certain scene, the story was great as usual from Christoper Nolan.

The war is always far off and distant, the impact on Japan only briefly mentioned, and the real person we are to have sympathy on is the title character. Even the building of the bomb lacked the challenge and exploration that it could have. It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter and even shorter focused less on the communism angle. While it hinted at why the bomb may have not needed to be dropped, since the viewer is left with no understanding of the state of the war with Japan it feels like more of an intellectual discussion than an in the moment approach to bringing the world's worst war to a close."

",/review/rw9296385/?ref_=tt_urv,"The movie was an 8 right up to the event--then the director for some reason decided to show an hour+ of repetitive hearings, drawing out the story but not adding any value to the film. We get it! Those in power wanted to punish Op and never renew his license. Having scene after scene drag this out drag this out drag this out was monotonous boring for the viewer especially with the film being so long. Some films flash right by, this one was great for a whole then dragged on. The many minutes showing the days of hearings did NOT add value or take the story forward. Overall: 6. I'm required to add fluff to this review."

",/review/rw9226151/?ref_=tt_urv,Christopher Nolan's incessant use of suspenseful music is a crutch heavily leaned on in Oppenheimer. It seems as though the filmaker believes that bombarding the audience with intense musical cues will create an illusion of tension and excitement. However it becomes evident that the music is attempting to compensate for what is simply a very boring story line!

",/review/rw9203549/?ref_=tt_urv,"Saw this tonight at a premier party in Oak Ridge, TN of all places. Packed house. Sold out in all theatres. Gotta admit I wish I had gone to imax just for a few scenes, but really, most of the movie was really about political drama as opposed to the atomic bomb. I was really impressed with the acting and think Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar. Nolan-maybe. Downey, probably no. I liked him and he did a great job, don't get me wrong, but I'll admit, until I realized the motivations of his character I didn't really understand his significance. Movie could have done a better job at pointing out what the political points were in the second half because I was little lost. I did think that the final third of the movie dragged a little but maybe that's because I was in about my 5th hour at the theatre, with the premier pre activities, and was pretty tired. I will say that, for me, the payoff was, after all the congressional hearings and back room interrogation, the last two minutes. It brought it all together for me. So, while I did love this movie, I can't quite give it past an 8 for some of the aspects that didn't just quite make it the experience I thought it was going to be."

This movie IS about Oppenheimer, just like the title states. All the ""buzz"" about the nudity was overblown. Was it necessary, no. Was is ""titillating"" in a hedonistic sense? No. It was kind of a non-issue, IMO. Is this a movie I'll watch again, probably not. It's about 30 minutes too long and I guess I don't find Oppenheimer a character worthy of admiration (other than his brilliant scientific mind). I'll concede I have not read much about him, so I wasn't compelled to learn his story. I expected more about the Bomb and it's effects on humanity--this movie was about Oppenheimer's life. It was done extremely well. Worth your time to view, but it won't be on my ""own"" list."

They are just thrown in. For the first time in my life I walked out of the movie. The actors and locations were there, but the director really went over the top this time. The movie was not for me. There are other movies which accomplice what is required without such a style. I suspect it will quickly be forgotten, as it is a fad. I really cannot find how anyone can describe this movie as good.

Seriously, I was prepared although not falling into this category but most of the audience I think did not understand a lot as they were too young and politically fragile. And that is not even touching the morals of the story or ancient history mentioned briefly. Or consequences for the Japanese that were so terrible.

Let's begin with the obvious: this is 100% Nolaned; the script is clean and meticulous; Robert Downey Jr stands out for best acting followed by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt; Matt Demon isn't credible; the music is too insidious; the visuals and the story itself aren't worthy of a big screen. Now that the most evident is dissected, here is the trick. The movie portraits an American patriot that oscillates between pride and guilt with enough elements to pull in both directions simultaneously. And when you think the script was a straight line without twists (and you would be right), subplots emerge to at least complete three hours of dialogues with emoted tension and resolution in the life of a scientist, the father of the atomic bomb, turned both monster and hero.

Missed the technology race against the nazies, the spies, the build-up to acutally dropping the bomb, the B29 Enola Gay story, the USS Indianapolis story, duck & cover, etc. So many stories behind this important part of history. Instead, lots of politics in a tiny board room and some kind of courthearings. But i should have guessed it from the movies title; it's all about the guy not about the bomb story.

He is soft and introvert which has been portrayed so perfect by murphy, i hope he gets an oscar for his performance in Oppenheimer. All others robert downey, emily , matt and pugh all did their supporting roles to perfect. Especially the strauss role played by our former iron man robert downey jr was world class, hope he gets an oscar too.

But I will say that it was interesting to see what went into building the atomic bomb seeing it from a different perspective... (as they have been many movies about the Manhattan Project). The actors, the script, the pace was great; however, the only negative I have for this movie is it could have done without the sex scenes. I am not a prude in any way, but these scenes were totally useless, and had no real bearing on the story telling.... In all honesty, it really seemed like just gratuitous sex to just tick a box for an r-rated movie. But it truly could have done without them. Other than that I thought it was a really good movie."

Hours after the movie's conclusion, scenes flashed in my mind, and I tried to piece them together, yet I found myself grappling with an unanswered question: ""What exactly do I feel?"" The movie had left me with an indescribable sense of wonder. The following day, my thoughts remained fixated on the movie, prompting me to focus on myself instead of researching it further. In this introspection, I realized that ""Oppenheimer"" stands apart from any other movie I have experienced. It isn't driven by piquant conversations about morality or philosophy like ""12 Angry Men"" or ""Network."" Instead, it allows you to immerse yourself in the sentiments of a REAL HUMAN, whose mind is brimming with complications and contradictions.

Try every thing and didn't achieve at all. Not only tries so hard to please everyone but also to not offend any. Even the US that is so the thing to critize nowadays, and i mean these dumb excuses about the nuclear boms. The message is extremely simple, like ""I'm 14 and that's deep"".

",/review/rw9295468/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan's daunting epic about the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, is an expertly made, fully engrossing biopic of the same gargantuan, self-centered proportions that we have come to expect of both Nolan's movies and the best films in this genre. Nolan's uncanny ability of weaving storylines and timelines together and interspersing them with intensifying moments and motifs makes Oppenheimer's at times overly discourse-based script come alive and the story's implications feel as momentous as they were. To make a film based around this many historical characters and meetings behind closed doors requires a remarkable sleight of hand, which Nolan again demonstrates that he has, but if Oppenheimer does have a deficiency, it is that it probably requires a viewer with a fair bit of historical knowledge or a solid historical interest. Luckily, Nolan has no trouble keeping his piece together despite its tremendous scope. He centres almost every scene and image around Cillian Murphy's wonderful, contemporary rendition of the titular character, who functions as a focal point which all attention is drawn towards. The inclusion of the Amadeus/Salieri relation between Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr.) may not turn out to be Nolan's strongest card, but as with the film's other dealings with the more controversial aspects of the story, it's handled with a certain amount of grace. A host of capable thespians from around the globe make up the extensive supporting cast, with special nods to Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, and David Krumholtz. The evocative score is by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson."

And it works. The editing, the time jumps, the sense of chaos, the awe-inspiring cinematography...it all adds stakes over and over. The first two hours just rocketed by. By the time they strapped on their goggles, I was somehow on the edge of my seat for a bomb test with a fairly predictable outcome. The third act dragged a bit, but this was still quite a feat.

Indeed, this movie is really an example of movies that are made for the cinema, not for the home. I would like to stress that this movie is not for all people. Yizenberg and many others, and all the details surrounding the Manhattan Project, whether announced or unknown, surprised me in the film and made me amazed that the film demonized America and its government. Literally, some of its people gather America in this movie. It was a demon. In a scene of Oppenheimer with the president of America after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosion, Oppenheimer tells the president, I feel that my hands are stained with blood. 250,000 people were on his neck, he felt about themselves and their suffering throughout his life, and in the end, his country fought him and made him a traitor, and at the end of his life they honored him after he accepted on himself that he was fighting with all those around him in order to only reduce the guilt that he felt. And I will not forget Oppenheimer Einstein's sentence when he said that there was an opportunity in the Manhattan Project that we are destroying the world with our invention. The truth is that we really destroyed the world, and the feeling of arrogance kept haunting him all his life. This movie is as sweet as it is, but it is dark and depicts the black history of mankind. Not only the future is the one that is full of injustice and corruption, not the past. I was afraid that he would fall into the point of drumming for America and filming it in the role of angel, like most directors, and I wanted him to at least take the field of neutrality, but it surprised me when he portrayed history as black as it is in the past after Germany's withdrawal and Hitler's suicide, and Japan was the salvation of itself, and this is how it will lose, but America also designed a nuclear strike to test it and show its strength."

The pacing is fantastic though once you get to the court scenes towards the end of the movie it can drag a little, but it's nothing drastic The message of the movie being ""just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should"" is perfect for Robert Oppenheimer's story.

Christopher Nolan is a master at conjuring up wild fantasies, but in ""Oppenheimer"" he needed to stay grounded. He needed to take the works of other writers and treat the story with the respect it deserves. On one hand, the film is a masterpiece, due to how Nolan presents Oppenheimers personal struggle, having invented the means to our own demise. On the other hand, it's a Christopher Nolan movie and his wildly outlandish and incoherent methodology of telling stories, feels like a child's finger painting when looking at the material he has to work with. Its clear there wasn't enough conflict during the rise of Oppenheimer, being the lead scientist at Los Alamos, so Nolan came up with a clever, all be it challenging to understand, method of creating some sort of through narrative which binds the three hours together. For better or worse, as the story unravels, it gets further and further engrossing and by the end, you honestly want more.

The acting performance is magnificent, probably the best of 2023, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey jr. Were brilliant.

",/review/rw9235555/?ref_=tt_urv,"The tension grows for a while but then it feels we never reach a climax that a 3 hour long movie would suggest. If you are ready to learn about the politics of the time mostly via dialogs, this movie may be for you. Nolan's work was always visually inspiring as well and had a good balance between dialogue, action and visuals. In this case the balance felt off. It's like one of those extended director's cuts when they really try to include everything even tho it comes with the loss of momentum. It's still an interesting film, but it feels that the shared premiere date with mainstream Barbie movie has created a bigger hype for Oppenheimer as well than the film actually deserves."

I would give the movie itself 9/10 but because of the amazing visuals plus sound editing, the cinematic experience elevates it so gets a rare 10/10 for me. The acting is superb. Murphy and RDJ give monstrous performances.

The film is centered around a trial against Oppenheimer and is mostly told through flashbacks. One through the biased POV of Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) and through Oppenheimer himself (Cillian Murphy). The film is long - and also feels very long. So you definitely have to be in the right mindset to sit down and watch. But I really enjoyed watching this exploration of this man and his psyche. The film poses a lot of questions about whether one should have this power. And it actually made me want to read a biography about him."

However, there were parts of the story that were overly long and laboured with some of the special effect interventions either unnecessary or too long & dramatic. The single most dissipate annoying feature of the film (a common issue today in film and TV) was the sound. There were barely 10 seconds of silence in the whole 3 hours. The dial was overlayed with 'music' or sounds for almost the whole film, even when just two characters were conversing. There were sections of dialogue in the film which I will never know as they were impossible to discern being drowned out by the accompanying sound. Disappointing."

",/review/rw9258877/?ref_=tt_urv,"From the start of the movie, I had the feeling I could see through the movie and not immerse in the experience as I expected, ...even though I was watching it on IMAX. Unfortunately, this feeling lasted until the end, and only the last scene where he imagined the future war pleasantly surprised me a little. From the explosion sequences in his imagination to the sex scenes, I have felt that all was engineered to trick the spectator that he watches a deep and immersive story which ultimately it wasn't at all, they were just tricks. The originality was that the tricks in this case were not CGI. The movie obviously had an epic PR that ensured box office figures despite the rather ordinary impression it makes. It is not bad, just an unimpressive triple A movie that will be forgotten until next year. I did not appreciate much the cast either, maybe I know Robert Downey Jr. Too well, his habits and gestures to have the feeling that his character is authentic, I would rather prefer the likes of Jeremy Irons for that role. Matt Daemon was also a stretch while for Cillian Murphy definitely was not the role of his career. One other thing about the movie was that I felt that it tried to bend history to fit current times with an ultra-liberal if not communist to be Hollywood. Overall, it was watchable, unlike 99% of Netflix productions, but not really a great movie."

The sex scenes were completely unnecessary, added nothing to the story. And in those days, it wasn't graphically presented like this. I guess the writers needed to smut it up to keep up with the times! I would never watch this movie again. The movies that I go to theaters to see, I usually end up watching again and again later on.

It's a compelling story. I can't claim to know anything about Robert Oppenheimer besides the history headlines, but it appears he was much more complex than the headlines would indicate. My only real complaint about this film is the score. I tend to love the scores of no Nolan's films, but this one is overbearing. It's too loud and intrudes on too many scenes. It's nearly constant, and that winds up detracting from the impact of some of the scenes, which, given how dramatic the score is, is exactly the opposite of what's intended. I found it pretty distracting, and a significant miscalculation. Nonetheless, this is one of those movies that everyone really ought to see. Side note about the story. I didn't really go into this knowing what to expect, but a significant part of the story and the plot center on the politics around the Manhattan Project during and after. This aspect of the movie for me was the most compelling part of it, in addition to oppenheimer's own grappling with the magnitude of what he had contributed to."

I will have to see it again to clear up in my mind which guys was which scientist. Einstein (obvious, of course) was a glorious character (as he was in real life), so I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Conti's portrayal of him. I am a huge fan of Matthew Modine - what a gift to see him on the big screen again. Gary Oldman is unreal (and unrecognizable) as Truman. Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Downey's (Strauss') advisor (don't know who the actor is) steal the last 25 minutes of the show. Wonderful work all around!"

I believe those are the movie's best aspects so I'll get to why I don't think it stands out among his best films. Though there is nothing wrong with dialogue carrying the plot, film is still meant to be a visual medium. When I found out that this film was based on a book, ""American Prometheus"", I was not shocked. This film just went too far with the dialogue and I feel like they didn't have to add every element from the novel into this movie. It just made it too long and too hard to follow. Again, well-acted with a fantastic cast and the social and political commentary was brilliant, but I felt it went too far with the back-and-forth between characters."

If you are not familiar with this, do a search for Slotin, Daghlian, and tickling the dragon's tail. Essentially, what Slotin did was to carefully move two hemispheres of nuclear material ever so slightly closer together in an attempt to see what happens just before criticality. Oops! Yeah, major oops. I suppose these things weren't include because they actually happened after Hiroshima and Nagasaki by which time the movie was mostly over. That's fair, I guess.

This film is not interested in hand holding or dumbing information down, nor is it interested in relaxing its pace so that those without at least some prior knowledge of the subject can catch up. This film moves at a cracking pace, effortlessly blending different time lines and events in a brilliantly crafted story that contains some of the best acting I've seen since Sir Anthony Hopkins took home the Oscar for The Father. Cillian Murphy is almost transcendental as J Robert Oppenheimer, so far does her disappear into the character. The rest of the cast is entirely on point as well, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking at points, and the soundscape is incredible.

I didn't felt a single scene was forced or amateurish. Coming to acting, Cilian Murphy delivers his career best performance, and Matt Damon was extraordinary and Robert Downey might have given his best acting till date. Even without a single fight scenes, Nolan has made this more interesting than most of superhero movies. I think the dialogues deserve extra credit.

A brilliant and fast paced movie throughout, this movie truly showcases just how good of a writer Nolan is. No other Nolan movie features this much dialogue and reminded me that Nolan's writing is often overshadowed by his directing skills. That being said, I do believe this film features his greatest directing ever. The acting was superb as Cillian Murphy turns in his best performance yet and was able to shine in nearly every scene of this 3 hour epic. The whole supporting cast was great with wonderful cameos all throughout, but I believe Robert Downey Jr. Deserves praise especially. The score perfectly encapsulates the intense nature of the film and even the sound mixing was spot on as my theater was genuinely shaking. The cinematography even rivals that of other impressive Nolan pictures such as Interstellar. This movie was very dense despite being 3 hours long and was truly the fastest 3 hours has ever felt as I still wanted more. This movie is thrilling throughout and will never leave you bored. Being a Nolan film, expect timelines to jump from one point to the next, but I think the way this was edited is truly his best work. I want to take more time to determine where this will fall on my rankings of Nolan's movies but already I know it's top 3. Any Nolan fan knows that being in the top 3 for this list means it is brilliant given the stiff competition. To see this film, myself and a few other Nolan fans were incredibly hyped for this movie for over a year and even drove an hour and a half away to see this movie on an IMAX screen. I now understand why it was so important to witness this spectacle as such because I have never felt more immersed in a movie before. Without a doubt a masterpiece and a perfect 10/10, do yourself a favor and find the biggest screen possible and let yourself be blown away from start to finish. This is Nolan at his finest."

I watched in horror as people applauded wildly when they learned about the devastation caused to the civilian population by the bombs dropped on Japan. I hope these images are just from an ordinary scenario. Murphy's acting is superb. I'll be surprised if he doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. I was horrified to watch this attack on the civilian population, which was not guilty of any crime in the history of the world, in the cinema. Not a movie for the summer months.

The cast is amazing and each actor performs like they never have before, particularly Murphy and Downey. The tone of the film transforms with the plot throughtout and the movie is plauged with themes of guilt that are expertly shown through Nolan's Directing and Cillian's acting. Towards the second half of the film the directing almost has a kind of aspect of horror. The film might be 3 hours but it does not drag at all and it leaves you wanting more by the end. The best scene is the scene containing the detonation of the atomic bomb."

My experience with ""Oppenheimer"" was similar. Although the movie initially captivated me, I found myself lost for about ten minutes due to my difficulties with English as a second language.

Each of these protagonists have notable face-to-face disagreements with their nation's heads of state. Both of them are bedeviled by nefarious mortal enemies invented to advance their movie's plots. In fact, the Salty dude from the earlier film is played by a seeming twin to Murray Abraham in the current exploration of masculine famous envy. AMADEUS and OPPENHEIMER both run about three hours, and each tale traces the decline of the titular leads, depicting their declining mental health, decaying physical constitutions and increasingly frequent hallucinations. AMADEUS won eight gelded statuettes, including the 1984 Best Picture prize. Can OPPENHEIMER top that? Stay tuned."

",/review/rw9264653/?ref_=tt_urv,"I don't understand Nolan's fascination with jacking up the volume of his films to a level that sometimes drowns out the dialogue. It's also not necessary to constantly play background music. I'm not a filmmaker but it's ok to let the dialogue speak for itself. At least with this one I could still hear the dialogue, unlike Insterstellar where much of the film's exposition was drowned out by banging music. I don't recall Nolan's earlier films being this way but I think it may have started around The Dark Knight Rises and definitely hit a crescendo with Interstellar. Anyway, clanging music aside, the film is very good. The acting is superb and the story, minus a couple frankly unnecessary sex scenes, is phenomenal. My favorite scene was the bomb test and the tension of expecting the loud bang that waits for a bit before it actually happens. There's an example where audio was used correctly. It was actually QUIET for what seemed like an eternity and then the loud bang kicked in at just the right time. I wish the music had been handled the same way for the rest of the movie. I also didn't have any problem with the length and while it was preachy at times, the story was still effective and I could see why Nolan has said it's a horror film. Fix the audio and this is a 10."

All the characters essayed the roles in a beautiful way too. Cillian Murphy looked and acted really like Dr. Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr.'s role as Lewis Strauss is a class apart too. From the promotions of this film, I thought Robert Downey Jr. Would play a side role, but his role was almost as important as the lead character in this movie. Nolan's play with the black-and-white scenes and their interplay with the chromatic scenes seem like a genius move. I would suggest people to watch it in IMAX, if possible."

I think the best way to convey the actual film aside from the circus surrounding it would be that had it not been publicised beyond belief and Nolan not been the director nobody would be talking about it! It's overly long, boring, it doesn't give away any real nuances about RJO's personality or build his character well....or give any real insights...... and they managed make the race to make the atomic bomb boring."

",/review/rw9254746/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Oppenheimer"" is a complete film, with three hours of little contemplation and a lot of dialogue that intertwine across various narrative lines: past, present, and future. The first standout aspect is the makeup. I was so immersed in the movie that I simply didn't realize that the feature includes actors like Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon. The actors are immersed in their characters. The cinematography of ""Oppenheimer"" is incredible, dark, and somber. The film's sound is spectacular, both in terms of mixing and editing. We feel the weight of each scene through sonic exploration, highlighted by a 20-minute sequence about the bomb test that is perfect; much of this is due to the sound quality. Another highlight in the artistic realm is Cillian Murphy's performance. The actor is completely absorbed by his character, which is visible through his performance, although some narrative choices don't explore this as they should. Although I'm not Nolan's biggest fan because his films are usually aesthetically untouchable and in terms of direction, his scripts often struggle to connect with the audience. They're so deep that they become shallow. However, in ""Oppenheimer,"" he manages to narrow this connection. The film could be more audacious at times, especially concerning the visceral consequences of an atomic bomb. Nevertheless, ""Oppenheimer"" is an almost perfect film, deserving an 8.5 out of 10."

Even with its three-hour runtime, it has a quick pace introducing characters and themes, making it a little dense at times. The script and storytelling are brilliant and engaging. Nolan's ability to turn a biopic into a deeply emotional cinematic experience shows why he is one of the best. There were moments when my heart was pounding and I even had goosebumps. The cast is one of the most ambitious aspects of the project, even secondary characters were played by recognized actors. Everyone delivers excellent performances, and I can already see Robert Downey Jr. Winning an Oscar for supporting actor. Visual and sound effects are captivating and immersive, even more so when you know the film does not have a single CGI shot. On top of all, Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack shows why he can be at the same level as Zimmer if he didn't already convince you with Tenet. Overall, an extraordinary experience in which you can feel how passionate were the people involved in the making of the film. Every aspect of it shines and blends remarkably to result in an emotional journey and I am sure it will have a lot of rewatch value as is usual with Nolan."

Along with Hoytema's cinematography and Göranssons spine-shaking score. The use of the black and white IMAX film is masterful. Although it is three hours, so, make sure your attention span is long and your brain is switched on. Pacing thought was not an issue due to the unbelievable tension.

Rober Oppenheimer deserved, it's about the physics world that Oppenheimer dominated at the time he was needed but also shows the dark , miserable political prosecution he endured after the war ended. I would say the story was actually quite predictable after all the promotion campaign and trailers,but it still captures the audiences with the cast's enticing and amusing performance and the biting interactions during the excruciating hearing. It lays out the controversies and debates about the releasing of the atomic bomb,as well as the moral struggles encircled Oppenheimer. The hypocrisy , irony and complexity of politics in the film was so well scripted that even the scenes jumped from Trinity test to the hearing time to time,I still set at the edge my seat to gaze at the characters. And the performance by Cillian Murphy was really impressive as he portraits Oppenheimer as the
super intelligent, arrogant, stubborn and sentimental physicist that was admired by many. The sound in the film complys perfectly with the plot and twist, making the film more grandeur and magnificent along with the visual treat. It's a typical Christopher Nolan film ,sensational and philosophical."

While this is a story, it is not the only story of the man and his times. Lost in this narrow focus is the compelling story of the race between Allied and German scientists to perfect the nuclear bomb, which caused once collegial physicists to restrict their open sharing of ideas with former colleges. Werner Heisenberg was in the German camp. Neils Bohr and Oppenheimer in the Allied camp. I commingling of these themes would have made for a richer more complex story and would have highted the injustice done to Oppenheimer in the face of his fealty to the Allied cause."

It is an experience with so much detail and attention to important things that motivated the physicist to come up with such a groundbreaking idea. This film proves to you why this was the most historical thing to happen, rather than just saying it. It opens your curiosity and wonder through the first half and as soon as the trinity test begins, it is nerve racking and intimidating how suspenseful the results are. The last half may seem like it's beginning to go nowhere, but redeems itself and shows the most powerful political message. It shows that after all of the contributions Robert Oppenheimer gave to the government to make sure this would work, he was now betrayed and left to the side after they took advantage of his work. It shows that our society needs to be careful and know that others may corrupt your accomplishments and take advantage of you, and have nothing to do with you. The last half was not only just a result of what the bomb did for the world, it shined on an insanely important political message. Amazing movie."

If anything I can easily imagine a miniseries that goes into even more depth, exploring more of the many characters' background or delving into the science more.

I had previously read the biography on Oppenheimer, which was an excellent book, highly recommend. And my girlfriend, and I went to this movie, she was lost for most of the movie, I followed everything well, but I think it would've been difficult at times I had I not read the book. Specifically the first third of the movie when they cover a lot of Events and material in a fairy quick and almost choppy fashion. The middle third of the movie where they are at Los Alamos is rushed and there is so much to tell about that. And there's just not enough time in a three hour movie. So I give this movie a seven which is probably the lowest I've rated a Christopher Nolan movie simply because , there's too much content for three hour movie, even though I think he did as well of a job as could be done by anyone really."

This thought provoking movie tells us exactly why that is so. If you don't know anything about what happened prepare to be amazed. It is based on a book and reading history might also be something you would enjoy. I was a little surprised at the style. A little chaotic and loud. It all comes together, though. One character, an ordinary (seriously smart) man called by unusual circumstances to participate in one of the greatest events in contemporary history. It also tells why anyone would ever do such a thing, for it is quite awful in every sense. Anyway, if you can get past the effort to get us into Oppenheimer's head using weird graphics and strange musical effects, the somewhat altered depiction of real events in the interest of storytelling, and the three hour run time, you may find yourself rewarded with a first class entertainment."

The only thing that kinda annoyed me was the constant music in the background of every scene. Cillian Murphy is outstanding in it.

Also alot of talk on the communism side of things and the politics involved in that, again,if you loose your concentration levels at all, you'll be lost.

Oppenheimer, in contrast was just not that appealing and certainly less than the sum of its many many parts and ultimately is a disservice to the extraordinary moment which brought together so many extraordinary people together for better or worse in The Manhattan Project. As many others have stated this film was overhyped as something that must be seen on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. For one absent one scene and a few 30 second cuts, there's nothing so requiring that type of scale. It's largely an office drama with an identity crisis. Sadly enough also, just oscar clickbait because this really wastes opportunities to delve into the imaginative scientific minds, the think tanks at Princeton, University of Chicago, UT-Knoxville, Bay area Universities, the strong european tradition that most of Manhattan Projects braintrust came from, or Oppenheimer's own personal upbringing, anything to reveal what made the subject tick and become the leader of such a weighty doomsday project. It also wasted the resource of an amazing amount of acting talent to no point. For despite everything that occurs in three hours the impression you are left with is that somehow the point of all of this is to produce The Richard Strauss Show by way of several minutes of Florence Pugh being provocatively naked and intellectual randomly with great lighting and makeup."

The timeline is a bit fuzzy but usually you will pick up the pace at the end, what I didn't understand is that is he a good person or a bad person did he ever regret what he did?

You don't have to like this movie if it's not your cup of tea, but if you say it is terrible, you are either straight-up stupid or insane. This is easily one of the best films of the year. If not the best, we will soon see, but I doubt it. This might not be my favorite Nolan film, but it might be his best and most Oscar-worthy.

This is made even worse by incidental & theatrical music that was so overpowering, this made listening to the dialogue even more difficult. Mark Kermode got it right. Pretty much 3 hours of a load of people, mainly men, sitting, talking & discussing politics, & the USA early atomic/hydrogen bomb programme. For the first time in I can't remember the last time I did, I actually fall asleep. I think the cinema that I attended had to crank up the volume so much that the sound quality it then became distorted. Unsure whether this was because they know that the dialogue is so quiet.

",/review/rw9203997/?ref_=tt_urv,"Films like Oppenheimer are the reason to go to a cinema to enjoy a film to the maximum. Perhaps at the end of the year it will turn out that Oppenheimer will be the best film that 2023 has produced and if not it will definitely end up in the top 3. Do not expect a film with a lot of action, because Oppenheimer has become a biographical film with a lot of dialogues and political issues in it. They are Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. They impress in the film, but the rest of the cast also does an excellent job under the wing of Christopher Nolan. The soundtrack may not be as memorable as Tenet's or let alone Interstellar (of course Interstellar was made by Hans Zimmer), but all the elements are on board and the crackle of the Geiger counter under the music really adds power and gets completely under the skin. If you get the chance to visit the film in IMAX, it is absolutely recommended, but if there is no IMAX theater nearby, the regular silver screen will also suffice. In any case, Oppenheimer is a film that you should not miss in the cinema, because you will spend three hours watching this feat in amazement."

30 August 2023,9," Exceptional, a tour de force for both Nolan and Murphy
",/review/rw9293772/?ref_=tt_urv,"The first expectation that was shattered on my viewing of Oppenheimer, was that it would be more or less an ordinary life story of the scientist, albeit told in a much better fashion by venerable Christopher Nolan. The movies manages however to be something more than that. First off, even despite Murphy's career-defining performance where I forgot he was ever anyone else but J. Robert Oppenheimer, it is incredible work on part of just about every actor in what almost seems an ensemble cast. That last observation alone is probably due to Nolan's masterful work though, but regardless, the result is stellar on that front. Next, for my part, I quite liked the somewhat non-linear storytelling, may I say I found it pleasantly engaging when telling about the man who was wrestling at a frontier of science now known as quantum mechanics. To put it another way, Oppenheimer appears deliberately ""chaotic"" at times, like it's simulating miniscule particles that make up the A-bomb, but it aims to do so at viewer's pleasure. Third, I appreciated Nolan telling the story in no small part through what was straight out interviews of Oppenheimer by his then-contemporaries. It's admittedly hard to put into words exactly how he enriched the movie through that particular aspect of it, but I just found it so rewarding watching members of Congress and other interview boards etc, talk to Oppenheimer and hear his responses, all through something else than a documentary, mind you. Nolan pulled a hat-trick there, no less. That's what I mean by him making something _more_ than just a good biography movie. At times, he wants to portray America v. Oppenheimer kind of story, and it's done oh-so-well you can barely notice it until later and how great it was that he did it. Last, but not least, the movie is masterfully shot and cut."

The visualization of the detonation of the atomic bomb was executed with uttermost brilliance and truly made me feel as if I am about to see with my own eyes, how perhaps one of the most dangerous weapons in the history of humankind is released into the world.

I was sucked in right from the start as the various cuts that followed were nice and overall it grabbed me right from the start. I enjoyed every moment and waited until the explosion of course. That's what interested me the most. Again, I wasn't disappointed, but what mainly improved it was the audio. I was expecting a nice spectacle. I got that. I had pretty high expectations there, so it didn't wow me that much, but it appealed to me very positively with Ludwig Göransson's music, which always drew me into the story. At one point, he had me pretty well riveted with his music as well. I was a little worried about how it would turn out without Hans Zimmer, but it turned out that it wasn't only Tenet who had such a great soundtrack, at least in my opinion. I liked the music."

",/review/rw9231666/?ref_=tt_urv,"The summer block buster! Oppenheimer probably and should win a few awards. Old days Oppenheimer would be just another good movie! A bit over hyped, but because Hollywood is so repetitive and woke. The public is tired of another super hero c g i movie, and/or wokism's disjointed stories characters and lectures etc. In contrast, Oppenheimer is just a true believable, and interesting story of a complexed flawed genius! Murphy best role, Redeye was good too, of a arrogant, self absorbed, selfish complex man who carried the weight of helping make a dooms day weapon. One experiences the academic silliness of who's smarter, the insensitivity/naïve of brilliant academic people. If anyone ever teaches or works in a lab one has seen this! Oppenheimer at the level of being so smart almost insane we get a glimpse of the apple part of the movie! Oppenheimer goes from black and white of how others see Oppenheimer and colors of how the protagonist see himself. The story blends Oppenheimer personal struggles with the the enormity of building of Los Alamos! Communist leaning intellectuals, infighting with the staff, mixes with the military and the project and ending a war sub stories. A good mix part war movie, part 80's soap opera. Matt Damon's character pushes forward the story of the general who knew how to push the smartest man in the room forward. Matt should get best supporting actors here. Well written, acted and crafted by the director Oppenheimer goes full circle of the frailties of jealous, arrogantly self absorbed political side of film which is identical to the academic characters which hits Oppenheimer when the scientist is no longer of use. A good crafted story, a heavy watch, but Oppenheimer did not feel like a 3 hour movie. 7 or 8 stars."

",/review/rw9216287/?ref_=tt_urv,"I watch most Christopher Nolan movies as they are long and in depth as he is a director that tries to state his case. His latest ""Oppenheimer"" is a well done look at a complex and important historical figure in scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer the developer who created and discovered the atomic bomb. The film is informative and it takes the viewer thru different time periods, while blending the life of a man with the current world. The cast and acting is all star form with Murphy who's great as Oppenheimer the chemistry is supported just fine by Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Florence Pugh. Along the way the scenes are tense as one can see that Oppenheimer has some regret and remorse after he created the bomb. It really takes one back to the days of the Cold War, communism, Hitler, and when Russia and Japan weren't friends of America. Over all any historical buff will enjoy this film as it leaves an impact just like Oppenheimer left impact."

I thought they got Teller and Szilard particularly well, after Oppenheimer himself. They also did a great job with Bohr and Lawrence, and even the small bits of Feynman's history are easy to see here. If you know this topic from the histories that have been written of it, you will recognize everyone. I'm surprised to say that I found Damon to be the weakest in his portrayal of Groves, but that could be the writing, as Groves was both a famously difficult man to work with and an overweight slob of a human. It would be difficult for anyone except perhaps someone like John Goodman to portray him effectively."
21 July 2023,9," Christopher Nolan, ladies and gentlemen!
",/review/rw9204365/?ref_=tt_urv,"I had the privilege to watch it yesterday in an IMax theater and it was a wholesome experience. This movie ranks for me among Nolan's top 3 films and there is nothing anyone could do to change my mind. Nolan jumped in a completely new genre other than the adventure, action and sci fi genre and he outdid most of the biography films I have seen. I also hardly watch any political films and surprisingly the movie could grab my attention that much. From the very first scene till the last the cinematography and the great Ludwig Göransson's score will take your breath away and I think the oscar for best cinematography and score has already been decided. Ludwig's score in this film overtakes some of Hanz Zimmer's top scores that I admire. The VFX is no doubt so well made as well and you already know that he didn't use a single CGI shot. The movie resembles Cillian Murphy's top lifetime performance and I doubt anyone could have done Oppenheimer better than him and I doubt anyone could top his performance this year and it would be a complete robbery If he didn't get the oscar this year. More importantly, this movie represents a savior for RDJ's career. The first half his time on the screen wasn't much enough and I started to doubt that he would be great at all, however, the second half of the film was ompletely driven by him. He will take your breath away with one of his all-time best performance and I doubt that he would!t get at least an oscar nom for this. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh's time on the screen wasn't much and I actually didn't like Florence's character at all. Emily did a couple of great scenes within the time allowed for her, but still I actually felt this character a bit weird and her relationship and actions with Oppenheimer wasn't clear enough for me. The editing of this film was also one of the heros got all these elements together and of course all of that wouldn't haven been possible without the great mr. Christopher Nolan. He easily can transform any element and any actor to the best form he could ever imagine of himself. All in all, it's a cinematic meal that you wouldn't wanna miss and the I-Max experience was one of a kind. A solid 9/10 and one of Nolan's all time top films."

Jason Clarke the Australian actor put in a subpurb performance as the hawkish prosecutor. Director Christopher Nolan is to the directors fraternity what Daniel Day Lewis is to the thespian club. A massive hands on effort. Gripping. The movie is looo...ng with little crash bang action. It's take up in many Asian countries/ communities would be limited. The ultimate dialogue spectacle. A thinking platform deluxe.

In the movie, there was more dialogues (especially in the train which doesn't made any sense) than the making of the bomb. The cinematographer was descent and Nolan did well. Murphy carried the whole movie. There was some miscasts but overall an average movie. The bomb test was a great experience, didn't expected it. It was like a biopic and anyone cam enjoy the movie with proper knowledge about Oppenheimer. People may watch the movie more than one time to understand the storyline. Just have to say that people expected more from Nolan."

Shocking, stressful, but mostly interesting. Every dialogue counts, every piece of historical insight is interesting. And the acting, just wow. This cast is so crazy that if you are not informed of the actors, you just keep getting surprised. I have to admit I'm not impressed by the filmmaking and the IMAX format and so on, but by the feelings this film produces. We will all leave the theaters stressed, because we now we live in a world in the brink of war, with nuclear deterrence playing a key role in keeping a ""Hot Peace"" but we can't fathom enough how dark and regretful the episode that the movie narrates was for human kind.

Interstellar and The Dark Knight are one of the best films I have ever seen in a theater so the bar was set pretty high. Fortunately, Oppenheimer mostly met my expectations. You definitely feel the runtime due to it being very dialoge heavy but I was never bored. The acting for the most part was great from every single actor but the script was pretty lackluster and the score which was haunting yet beautiful at times became way too intrusive during certain scenes. The movie did do a fantastic job at helping anyone unfamiliar with the dangers of atomic bombs understand that they can literally destroy the entire planet. My problem with Oppenheimer is that something felt like it was missing and I can't quite put my finger on what it is. Maybe it was the pacing which for a 3 hour long film was surprisingly way too fast. It is definitely very overhyped and nowhere near Nolan's best work, but overall I enjoyed it even though I won't be revisiting the film anytime soon."

What is even worse, the unnecessary part is the more interesting. Because what is the main plot? Some jealous scientists beef, what they are trying to solve with shady political backstabbing. That's it. The movie is 3 hours long, and the Manhattan-project is only a side-story, because Oppenheimer met with Strauss AFTER the war. I feel the movie wanted to grab too much: a little bit of documentary, a little bit of spy movies, and drama. But because of this, it can't achieve a good result any of these fields. And let's talk about, the movie is a 3 hours long dialogue between characters, without any pause. Camera change every 3 seconds. Maybe I'm too European, but come on, where were the long shots? Music? I know, Nolan didn't work with Hans Zimmer this time, but I cannot recall any music from the movie, everything what they played was just annoyed more me, because it was just stuffing more and more into the movie without any reason. Only good part of the movie are the actors, who did very good, but good actors can't save the sinking ship. I don't understand the hype around this movie, when its clearly has huge-huge problems."

No necessarily but I think it's of the cloth of all those films like the Godfather, 2001, Shawshank ect. I think this is the best Nolan film, I think he truly made his magnum opus here and I can't wait to see if and or when he trys to top this.

",/review/rw9256379/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan's (Inception/The Prestige) latest about the man who invented the atomic bomb as played by Cillian Murphy (after playing the Scarecrow for him in his Batman trilogy). Unfolding in a non-linear timeline when Murphy is recruited by the military, personified by Oscar winner Matt Damon's general, to compose a team to work on the bomb, a presidential confirmation hearing for a cabinet position for a former military man, Oscar nominee, Robert Downey Jr., & a tribunal of sorts to confirm Murphy's security status which turns into a mock trial about his loyalties. W/Murphy in virtually every scene, we get a sense of what made the man tick as his thoughts were constantly on what he was engrossed by: the creation of a destructive force which he would ultimately regret bringing to fruition. W/a panoply of hot actors (too many to mention but it could make a good drinking game to take a shot when someone you recognize comes on screen), past Oscar winners & Nolan's penchant for making his sound design & score, composed by Ludwig Goransson, as much a character as the ones on screen (& which may fray some nerves for its constant presence), we may not have the pomp & circumstance one would expect for a film being hyped as an Imax experience (when the totality of the scenes in the film consists of people arguing in rooms) but the presentation is of such professional sheen, you'll forgive Nolan's obvious hucksterism in his final pitch."

Whole movie keeps you on the edge. Build up is phenomenal, waiting for July 16th 1945 and when it happens, it all make sense.

Cillian Murphy deserves all the praise in the world for his delicate, almost Shakespearean work as the tragic Oppenheimer. He carried this movie like Atlas. The rest of the actors are great too (RDJ is a great antagonist).

",/review/rw9220668/?ref_=tt_urv,"I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nolan fan, so my expectations for this movie weren't high. Nevertheless, it was even worse then I expected. By worse, I don't mean unwatchable, but boring and average af. The dialogue is so crushingly pathetic, shallow, even cringe at moments, it feels like AI wrote it. Visually, there's nothing new, you won't be mind-blowed, which is perfectly fine, but that leaves us with.... nothing to write home about. I came to a conclusion that it would perhaps be better if Nolan solely directed his movies and left writing to others, as it really isn't his strength. This is not movie-related but I'll write it anyway because I can: it would be really nice if directors like Nolan who have a huge fan base and are capable of making good and fresh movies (which I think he is, see: Following) would really do that instead of a vanilla movie made to please everyone and therefore offering nothing of substance. There aren't many people with that kind of reach and I assume liberty/funds to do what they want, so I guess my point is that in a perfect world it would be a moral obligation to use that power to move boundaries and broaden our horizons. This is of course not a direct attack on Nolan, maybe the guy really is restricted by the industry and not allowed to do witty and meaningful movies, who knows. I only wish there were more artist showing the middle finger to the Hollywood studios and insisting on doing their thing (David Lynch I love you)"

It is a compressed ball of emotions with guilt, conflict, pain, remorse, anger, repression, shame, sacrifices. The level of pressure is intense given the political context and conflicts of cost-gain, progress- stop, science-politics, different beliefs, regimes that people follow and different religions where the world is filled with mass killings, doubt and hatred. More killing is the ""only"" way out of a war and people continue to frame each other with lies and abuse after war. It is outraging how people give themselves the power to determine the life and death of innocent people living across the planet, justifying that it is to put an end to even more killings. Oppenheimer was Jewish and he chose to work for the Manhattan project partially for his people, and the starting point was grounded in scientific curiosity and to defeat the Nazis. Yet he set out on a path of no return, where he has no control over the use of the bomb but must forever bear the weight of the bombing."

It's an interesting story and certainly would have deserved a 9 were it not for two major flaws that are common in movies these days but taken to absurd excess here. First, the sound. It was so muffled and echoey, and the music and sound effects were so overwhelming, that my friends and I missed at least a third of the dialog. Since the drama depended on the dialog, this was a serious error in judgment. At times, it was obvious something very humorous was occurring in the dialog, but the entire audience just sat in confused silence trying to figure out what was going on. And then there were the frequent changes in scene. Just as you are settling into a scene, suddenly the story jumps to a different city, with different people, in a different decade. Between the inaudible dialog and the frenetic changes in scene, the film was often difficult to follow. I look forward to watching this with subtitles to see what I missed."

The narrative alternates between a trial in the late 1950s and the development of the atomic (fission) bomb between 1942-45. Nolan uses color when presenting events from Oppenheimer's own perspective, but switches to black & white when recounting them from the perspective of others.

With more epic and historical scale than his previous works, Christopher Nolan presents cinematic perfection in terms of directing, screenwriting, visual effects, cinematography, casting, and music scoring. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a career-defining performance in this 3-hour film that is sure to be reckoned with in this year's film award competition.

It's not action heavy flick and it's mostly reliant on dialogue and conversation between the characters. My favourite part of Oppenheimer is that the story, characters and events were riveting despite the fact I knew comparatively little about the Manhattan Project going into the theatre. I was enraptured by these backroom political machinations and long conversations in classrooms, everything felt pertinent to the story and despite the contemplative pace, I couldn't turn away. If you're worried that some elements of Oppenheimer may go over your head, it shouldn't deter you from going to see it.

",/review/rw9258078/?ref_=tt_urv,"This is a great work of cinema. The through line is the walking on the sides of the moral line that Nolan projects in the film. What one needs to know before going to see this film is born in the title. This film is about the internal anguish, at times, Oppy, himself is not sure of. It's about a man who has the power but waivers about his conviction of the exertion of that power. This is a power he believes he must exert. His power is like Sophie's Choice. He has to choose one or the other and either decision provides both good and evil outcomes. There are winners and losers. Humanity wins and loses at the same time. I think writer/producer/director Nolan puts this across very succinctly. Technically the audio visual choices are superior. The sound editing and score gives you the feeling of a snowball rolling down a hill. It doesn't let up. Just goes faster and gets larger as it keeps going Down."

The usual polished performances, particularly from Robert Downey Junior and Cillian Murphy, but I think the story was so politically focused and not enough emphasis was given to showing the impact and fallout of the Hiroshima & Nagasaki bombings. Surprised no actual footage or reconstructions were used. Also a Japanese perspective would have added another dimension.

This is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. The movie did a great job of helping the audience feel, in a small way, how being a genius can be an amazing thing or debilitating. Women wanted to sleep with him and men wanted to be him, or probably, would or did sleep with him as well. He was very similar to a cult leader and could get almost anyone to like him, heck, I fell in love with him. I like how we still don't know if creating the atomic bom the right thing. Yes, Russia or Germany could have made a bigger one and detonated it over another country, including the US, but couldn't we have showed how much damage the bom could have done by dropping it in the middle of the ocean? Who knows, it's impossible to know, which is why the movie was so intense. I would have given it a 10 but there were some parts that were a little cheesy, like all of the celebrity cameos.

Nolan has broken the boundaries of conventional movies to create an experience beyond the pages of a script or the timeline of a plot. He shows he is in absolute control over what the audience catches and misses in every line of dialogue, in every shot, and uses that as his instrument to craft his symphony. The tension building throughout is paced in a well-balanced ocean of waves, rising and releasing, to carry the viewer to stranger shores.

",/review/rw9205772/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Oppenheimer"" is a three hour, dialog- driven narrative that's nearly the life story of the man chiefly responsible for inventing the atomic bomb. The movie gives Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. The roles of their careers, as they become dueling scientists over the years. Emily Blunt brings a stark intensity to the role of Oppenheimer's wife. There's a twenty minute sequence just before and after the test explosion in the desert that displays the anticipated visual thrills, but viewers looking for mind-blowing effects throughout will be disappointed. Audiences looking for a rather sophisticated depiction of a troubled period in global history, however, might enjoy this. Gary Oldman is on screen for no more than 90 seconds near the end, but he gives a devastating portrayal of President Truman, who meets with Oppenheimer briefly, weeks after the end of the war. The movie not once falls into the trap of trivializing the subject by being a roller coaster ride of special effects, and for that reason alone, Nolan should be congratulated."

However, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly illustrates how rapidly the world of physics changed in the 30's and the urgency with which the, largely Jewish, group of scientists leapt into action to kick some Nazi ass. The pen is mightier...with the caveat, Gen. Groves also kind of a badass to make it all happen. Not a ten because I'm thick and had trouble following the story line involving Strauss/Oppy conflict. (the isotope story? I needed more info) Even though the Editor will get Oscar nom., Even though using B&W is a cue, I felt like I was playing catch up in all the Downey scenes. No fault of R. D.'s, he was pitch perfect. As was Murphy, Blunt and Damon. Assassins all. In a good way, this movie is very dense. I'm not a fan of having to watch something more than once to completely absorb the story. The naturalistic, quick, sometimes muffled dialogue, took a minute to get used to. But once I let go and assumed I was in good hands it got better. The three hours flies by. I saw the 70mm print, yes it's worth the extra bread. I wept for mankind after the ""successful"" test.

He & Emily Blunt we're the two best in the movie although all did outstanding work. Lots of history and intensity to fit into 3 hours. But done well. Not rushed yet It didn't feel like three hours. I didn't know hardly any of the story at all and I followed it just fine. Example: I didn't know Los Alamos was built specifically to bring in the scientists & staff to build the bomb... The Manhattan Project. Film is done in flashback & then the timeframe starting several years after bomb was exploded, which is done in black&white so you can always tell where in history they are.

Howerver the movie is not for everyone, its sophisticated and not all people will grasp it from the beginning. It's twisting and you have to concentrate with everything begind said, every name and every character in the movie because this movie is like a puzzle and you put the pieces together to get the full picture. 3 hours long and really slow rhythm and that's it's only draw back. Sone dialogues were boring in parts of the movie but once you finish the movie you will realise that these boring parts were needed but towards the end the rhythm is accelerated and that was necessary. People who like the spoon like info and pop corn movies would definitely say that this was a bad movie and would give it a 1-3/10 but that would be a disgrace for the movie. And RDJ was giving the performance of his life. It is an oscar performance and he is going to be a strong nominee. Overall this movie can only be watched in the cinema because at home, you will never get the magic of it. The black and white scenes were my favourite in this movie."

",/review/rw9219536/?ref_=tt_urv,"I was not disappointed when I left the theatre and there wasn't a moment in the three hours I was there that I wasn't enthralled with the story. Some say that biopics lack suspense, but I found myself holding my breath. That's what good filmmaking is, and boy does Christopher Nolan know what he's doing when writing a story for the screen. This of course was based on true events, but the format in which Nolan shows us the story is reminiscent of Memento with the dual perspective black and white vs color, that I think works really well here. The women in the film were not reduced like they often are in historical biopics, but they were characters with their own arcs and developments. The practical effects were visually captivating, and film choices like camera angles, lighting, and soundtrack all helped add meaning behind the visual while at the same time immersing the viewer in the time period."

Cillian Murphy is amazing in one of the most enthralling performances of his career. The story has numerous characters and each cast member brings a spectacular addition to the story.

It's like looking at Lex Luthor as being a superhero. Oppenheimer created the most awful invention in the history of humanity and he should be looked at with disdain, not applauded. If the world does get blown up by nuclear weapons it will be thanks to this man. I hope people understand that so they don't see this movie with rose colored glasses. War is hell and nuclear war is Armageddon. I don't worship war profiteers for that very reason."

But let me first start by saying this movie isn't for everyone. In a world where people are used to over-the-top action movies, Oppenheimer is certainly way out of left field. It's very scientific, very historic, and frankly too high-brow for a large portion of the American public. But if you're the type that enjoys truly good cinema, you're in for a treat."

",/review/rw9290280/?ref_=tt_urv,"As was expected with Christopher Nolan's brilliance, Oppenheimer will blast away all your critiques & emotions with the perfect blend of Drama, Storytelling, Politics, Government consiracies & more. The first act went away in a fast-paced manner which is very Nolan. While the second act builds up, the actual blast sequence is so well shot and edited that you can't help but shake in anticipation as if you are part of the first few to ever experience the Historic moment for the first time ever. The amazing story doesn't end there as you still have 90 minutes of Political & Social goodness where we dive deeper into the rabbit hole. The third is actually so terrifically satisfying as all is revealed & I was reminded of all previous Nolan movies. Everything from A-list Cast, Writing, Story, Direction, Visuals & ofcourse the amazing scores of Ludwig Goransson mix up to give out a gorgeous display of a story that keeps on unfolding.

The intensity between the scenes, the slow yet powerful background... The creative mind behind the use of colours, and the impact it created. The movie is not just about a bomb or how is it build.. It's about the process one goes through while trying to make a change for his country. Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer has delivered one of the best performances of his career. But the x-factor comes out as RDJ. The emotions which were needed were perfectly delivered by him. In short, Oppenheimer is not everyone's cup of tea but those who love the reality stricken movie will definitely love it."

While Oppenheimer advertises on his creation, where it delivers is its exposure and reveal of the upper echelon of war and how something as concrete as us versus them can turn into you versus the world. Having that impending doom loom over his shoulders yet having to stand and listen to escalation at every level of more and more is where this film will make your hair fall out, and not from radiation but that which is much worse, stress. I love this movie and believe Nolan made a traditional documentary story into a riveting revelation about how the world is forever changed. We could all stand to watch this movie with held breath."

This movie is most likely going to be my movie of the year due to Nolan's skill as a top tier director. The way that the film balances the black and white (objective scenes) and coloured (subjective scenes) is masterful and so well done. Even with no prior knowledge about Oppenheimer you will be surprised at how much you can relate to his feelings by the end of the film."
22 July 2023,6," Worst Nolan movie!
",/review/rw9206133/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Worst Nolan movie! It's worth watching, but I'm not sure if it's worth the ticket. The story isn't bad because it's a true story; in fact, if you watch 'Fat Man and Little Boy,' you get the same story (albeit with fewer details), and it's a good story, even though the film is old and follows a linear structure. However, compared to Nolan's own films like 'Memento,' the structure of 'Oppenheimer' is indeed weak. 'Memento' is one of the best films in the history of cinema with that kind of structure. Also, you can take movies with a much simpler story that could be told in a short time, like David Finch's 'The Social Network,' which uses the same type of structure and works very well because it has the right amount of cuts and flashbacks. The film is already long, and so many flashbacks for a story like this made the movie tedious. Could see lots of people on their phones after 2h into the movie."

",/review/rw9227682/?ref_=tt_urv,"There is nothing to write home about this one. Sure, the acting is decent and the photography is ok, but that is a standard for any solid movie. It is hard to make a masterpiece when you have predefined limits of a biopic genre. Directors usually don't have enough creative freedom to really push the limits. Maybe it's just me but I don't find the story or protagonists very compelling. I actually love science but this was already familiar matter to me. Also, it feels too long and the narative is a nothing new, present day actions interweaved with flashbacks from the past. If I would want to watch a biopic I would rather choose a movie like Aviator, Air or something similar."

The first part is an character study, the second part dwells around the trinity test and is shot in an kind of eerie almost horrific way, the soundtrack makes the trinity test even more horrifying, and the third part is a court drama.

It should have been a 3-4 season series on Netflix or HBO. The entire movie was too fast, not giving time for the incredible cast to strut their stuff, or the viewers to absorb the complexity of science, moral choices or the fine acting of Murphy. There were single lines in the film that could have been made into a one hour episode. Nolan's choice of animated depiction of quantum physical matters was amateurish at best."

",/review/rw9207295/?ref_=tt_urv,"Once and for all.....Oppenheimer was NOT the father of the atomic bomb. The basic premise of chain reaction was Leo Szilard. Einstein did not write a letter to Roosevelt (he only signed it) Leo Szilard did. Fermi was only partly in charge under the bleachers. Leo Szilard saw his prediction completed there. Oppenheimer was a bureaucrat, a manager who was put in to co-ordinate a host of scientist, many of whom were Oppenheimer's better. And I wonder that not one person bothered to remember the first class BBC production made decades ago. If there is a father of this invention it was Szilard who in the end hated it."

",/review/rw9231106/?ref_=tt_urv,"Before even providing my thoughts I will say watching this is a mental exercise in itself. Not only is it 3 hours, but it fires information at you the entire time. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but there will almost certainly be times where you are trying to figure out which character is which when they refer to them by name. Perhaps we could have got to know a couple of the key players better rather than getting lost in the static. Another aspect the viewer must deal with is trying to piece the timeline together on the fly. It's not that difficult once you get into it, but nevertheless a nuisance at times. It might be a movie where you get a lot more value on the second watch through, but at the same time it's hard to envision giving up another 3 hours to do so."

One time the film made me shiver: What if Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists would have accomplished their work three months faster? Would I even exist? And the perspective that Nolan takes is laudable: this is a film about America's inner conflicts and contradictions as much as it is about an American hero."

Through three different timelines, we study Oppenheimer's rise in the scientific community, his fractured relationships, the rat race against Nazi Germany to create World's first Atomic Bomb, and the conspiracy against him to silence his call for de-escalation of arms race. Once again Nolan has made a Technical Masterpiece, from editing, cinematography, practical effects and sound design and with a stellar cast of incredible actors.

",/review/rw9205826/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan gave cinema one of the most powerful and stunning biopics in history. In his 12th feature length film, Nolan takes on J. Robert Oppenheimer and his story leading, building and the aftermath of the atomic bomb. Definitely one of the best visual films in Nolans filmography and in recent cinema, ""Oppenheimer"" manages to turn one of the worlds most destructive weapons, into a mind-blowing, beautiful masterpiece. Nolan used two styles of visuals to portray the story, a first person perspective when the film was in colour and a third person perspective when it came to the black and white scenes, this helped to distinguish the difference between events for viewers especially with how much information was in the picture and really immerse the viewer in J. Robert Oppenheimer's position as these events unfolded and what he now carried with him as ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb"". I can easily say that Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are clearly in the running for Best Actor and Supporting Actor as they both provide some of their best performances to date. However I will add that the entire cast was on their A-game anytime they were on screen. The fact that Nolan has addressed that there is no CGI used in this picture is phenomenal and after watching this film you can appreciate that so much more, everything was visually beautiful and the sound design on top of that was amazing. I have never watched a film and physically felt the magnitude of what was on screen. Every single explosion was felt as if you were in the observation area with the cast. My only issue that came with this film was the 3 hour runtime actually felt like 4. As some films manage to speed through 3 hours and leave you wanting more, this did not have that affect for me. However it is still a 5/5, it is in my top 3 for Nolan films and is definitely one I can rewatch no problem."

The title is aptly chosen as it is primarily a biopic that intricately charts Oppenheimer's life trajectory. It delves into his early interests in quantum mechanics, the genesis of the idea to create a bomb, his struggle for inclusion in the program due to his affiliations, and the painstaking process of assembling a team to actualize the bomb. The movie also depicts the only explosion he witnessed - the Trinity Test - and emphatically highlights that he was not present in Japan during the actual bombings. Most importantly, the movie poignantly portrays his post-war change of heart and his subsequent fight against the further development of atomic weapons."

Oppenheimer touches on so many subjects, and enters the psyches of each character so effortlessly, adding new layers to the film through every dialogue, every frame and every character.

Of course, its a beautiful movie with top actors but it has a problem about the general structure of the story. It does not have the narrative fluidity of a Spielberg movie.

Of course, the director's approach adds rhythm and current events to what used to be dull scientific experiments. But my favorite part is the imaginative explosion scenes, truly mind-blowing. It reminds me of when I was searching for answers, why people in space know it's a vacuum even though they've never been there. That led to the design of space suits.

Whatever the movie looked like to you, there was definitely a scene that made you feel strange in your place Especially when Oppenheimer talks to the crowd, this is the best chris' scene for me in his filmography. The mixture of it's soundtrack and the scene was so unique that you felt like you were in a horror movie... You feel very boring in the film. You feel too extended. Sometimes you don't feel like this film is about Scientist Robert. The romantic scenes were very strange Big stars ( Florence Pew & Emily Blunt ) I wish these romantic scenes would pass, not to mention Albert Einstein's scenes starring Tony Dalton I guess I felt that way... but on the other hand, because of the great acting of Killian, Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon at the top, I felt like in my film most of the time in the plots this Nazi rivalry and competition The making of the bomb and then the destruction of Hitler and its use against Japan was seriously very uniquely deep for this case the film was at its peak and then very uniquely playing with the time of the film Christopher Nolan brought to another era Without spoiling the story and shown very beautifully in the end it was really unique I was reminded of Memento, which is a Christopher Nolan film and this is how he plays with time without spoiling the story and very beautifully rewritten !"

So when we get a movie where such artists join at the pinnacle of their talents, in perfect timing, with the perfect story, and the perfect theme, when age and experience now allow them to give us a piece of work that is so far above and beyond the general output, craft-wise and thematically, then it deserves to be called ""something of a miracle""."

",/review/rw9209769/?ref_=tt_urv,"The story of J Robert Oppenheimer 'the father of the Atomic bomb' in the hands of Christopher Nolan is a somewhat over inflated dialogue heavy affair. The film flashes back and forwards in time, and is often engrossing, particularly during build up to the first A-Bomb test, but it also gets bogged down in talky scenes focused on political and scientific controversies both during and after WW2. I thought that perhaps a more economical approach could have made Oppenheimer truly gripping and great, and could have helped explore more effectively the post WW2 period when Oppenheimer fell foul of McCarthy era investigations. I also found the music score often unnecessarily intrusive and annoying, further highlighting a sense of the film being just a bit over done, however, there were still things to savour, not the least an uncannily vivid and convincing performance by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, plus many other excellent performances, effectively making the acting the best thing about the film. I thought Oppenheimer was a largely coherent and informative though rambling portrait of the man, wonderfully performed, meticulously written and directed by Nolan, but just pretty good when just a bit more economy might have made it great."

Lets use 10 seconds for almost all the clips. Unbelievable. If you like this film then you will like Star Wars 10 as well. Cannot believe it is edited this way.

Put together: Motivation, lack of motivation, madness, genius, success, fame, conscience, regret, empathy, betrayal and many other scenarios and feelings in a single work bordering on the impossible, which the director should already know. Speaking and explicitly showing the political scenario of the Second World War era on the big screen is not an easy job, which makes it impossible to fully understand what one wants to convey through frames and scenes that are so opaque in sense, when at the same time full. The superficiality of the work has to be noted. A lot of elements were used, as there was no escape, so it makes the pace slower and more angsty, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

To communicate to an audience who may have known very little about the war and the holocaust the urgency of Oppenheimer and others. He could have set up one of the most famous quotes ever a little better. My thoughts on that would have been for Oppenheimer to whisper it to Tatlock and to make sure the audience doesn't hear it until after Japan surrenders as his colleagues celebrate. The movie needed Zwick for the emotions of war and romance IMO. The good about this movie is the excellent performance of Murphy and the great cameos, including Oldman as Truman."

The cast is filled with A-list leading men and women, many of them in small parts with extremely limited screen time. The cinematography by Hoyt van Hoytema is breathtaking. The score by Ludwig Gorannson is stressful and beautiful at the same time. Cillian Murphy is a revelation as Oppenheimer, commanding the screen as the father of the atomic bomb. Robert Downey Jr. Gives the best performance of his career as Lewis Strauss. Emily Blunt is a standout as Kitty Oppenheimer, her own scenes often brilliant and powerful. The smaller roles in this cast are all great. Casey Affleck is incredibly unsettling when on screen, while Alden Ehrenreich is great. The standout performance of all of the smaller roles is Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock. This person, someone so important to the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, is often portrayed as this seemingly bi-polar, waifish, lost soul who drags Oppenheimer down. In this film, Pugh gives an incredibly nuanced performance, equal parts lustful and headstrong. Josh Hartnett is great, loved seeing him in a big film again. Rami Malik was great, really enjoyed him in this. Gary Oldman as Truman was an incredible portrayal; simultaneously the politician and the good old boy. This film should be the frontrunner for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Production Design, Best Sound Design, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects (considering all of the SFX work was done practically!) Robert Downey Jr. Should win Best Supporting Actor, while Cillian Murphy should absolutely win Best Actor. One of the best historical epics I have ever seen 10/10!"

",/review/rw9250203/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie was amazing, I loved everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack. I really liked how the main focus wasn't on the atomic bomb but Oppenheimer himself, I like how the movie wraps around the entire story, especially with the time jumps. Pretty much throughout the entire movie, there would be scene cuts to an interrogation room with different characters you see throughout the film, giving what it seemed like a testimony, at first you have no idea what's going on but as the story begins to wrap up at the ending, it all builds up and makes you feel excited and ready to jump out of your chair, I loved how when the atomic bomb went off you could see the despair in Oppenheimer's eyes, as he slowly realizes what he's created, but what I really enjoyed was the movie finally making clear of our antagonist, Admiral Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss near the ending, I really loved was how the soundtrack during this time was so suspenseful, revealing why we have always been jumping around back to that interrogation room, I really liked the motives, the envy of what Oppenheimer has created, the whole ""A bomb vs H bomb"" motive was really cool. Overall, great movie, would see it again!"

There were many times I had to read lips because some annoying background music or rumbling sound or just plain noise grew so loud that the dialog could not be heard. It wasn't even there to evoke emotions like anticipation or fear; it was just noise. And visually, how hard do you need to try to screw up the film of a nuclear explosion?

The opening scene of the movie which features a haunting background theme and Oppenheimer facing a bureaucratic enquiry on him against his appeal to revoke his security clearance in Atomic Energy Comission but rejected because of his affiliation with communist community. Seemingly lost in his thoughts , Noland took a dive to Oppenheimer's early days where he could be seen working as a researcher in Cavendish Laboratory under Cambridge University in England. Interacting with Neils Bohr , who suggested him continuing his theoretical research on Quantum Physics which wasn't much popular in the USA back then , he returned to his homeland where he worked with Ernest Lawrence who invented the ""Cyclotron"" after completing his PhD in physics in Cambridge, until he was approached by General Leslie Groves to get involved in Project Manhattan to develope the first neuclear bomb. Assuring Groves about his zero sympathy towards communism , Oppenheimer takes charge of the project and gathers all of the industrial might available in the USA to develop the first atom bomb before Nazi Germany could make one. The movie then proceeds with further Historical events towards the event where they successfully conducted the ""The Trinity Test"" . After the Hiroshima and Nagasaki event Oppenheimer finds himself guilty for the reason of the death of the countless people and starts to advocate the adverse effects of neuclear bombs in human civilization which was not received well by Lewis Strauss, a chairperson in Atomic energy commission who ploys his plan to strip Oppenheimer of his political influence."

Still, my main thought was ""unbelievable. I have just witnessed Nolan's masterpiece."" Long has Nolan been a director I admire for his technical accuracy, complex topics, and what he reveals about humanity.

",/review/rw9208689/?ref_=tt_urv,"Saw OPPENHEIMER on Saturday in its 70mm large format screening. Really a phenomenal piece of filmmaking by writer and director Christopher Nolan, the story centered around the Father of the Atomic Bomb and leader of The Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, J. Robert Oppenheimer, played to perfection by actor Cillian Murphy. Worth noting, as well is the extraordinary performance by actor Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss. It wouldn't surprise me if both actors receive Oscar nominations for their character portrayals, they are that good! Also great in supporting roles, Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer), Matt Damon (General Leslie Groves), Jason Clarke (Roger Robb) and an appearance by Gary Oldman as President Truman. Returning as Nolan's DOP is Hoyte van Hoytema (Interstellar, Dunkirk, Tenet) whose cinematography in Oppenheimer is breathtaking. Love the new black and white photography created especially for the film, it is sharp, clean and crisp. Just like in Nolan's 2000 film, Memento, the black and white is juxtaposed with color, perfectly utilized for past and present scenes and as a way to interpret the lead character's moral struggles and ambiguity. I had no problem with the 3 hour runtime, dialogue was intelligent and the film moves at a good pace thanks to streamlined editing by Jennifer Lame (Tenet) and a strong, haunting score by Ludwig Göransson (Tenet). Oppenheimer is quite the triumph for Chris Nolan."

2 September 2023,1," missed a big occasion
",/review/rw9300980/?ref_=tt_urv,"Nolan missed a big occasion to talk about scientific approach to the event of that historical period. He describes a character involved in his personal limits in which the making of the bomb is just an excuse for portrait sexual behavior, intrigues, duels, betrayals.... and so on. The movie talks about Oppenhaier but doesn't face the scientific study that led to the realization of the bomb. Dialogues are often uselessly emphasized in constant search for the pace. So, relationship, dialogues, scenes seem full of exaggerations at the expense of the scientific argument. Some actors seem don't fit the character.... look at Matt Damon interpretation. He looks too much rigid in many scenes."

",/review/rw9227782/?ref_=tt_urv,"Like many people I admire Nolan as a filmmaker, I think he's the closes thing we have to a Kubrick in the modern day, not so much for his style or sensibilities but merely for the fact that each film he makes has ambition, often tackles different genres, they're high-budget films but also intelligent and artistically accomplished. Also his name is well known enough that each new film he makes is an event. Personally my favorites of his are Memento, Interstellar, The Prestige, Insomnia, I also admire Inception though it has some flaws imo. Don't care much for his Batman films, to me they are not entertaining enough and don't really capture the spirit of Batman from the comics (Tim Burton did a better job with that)."

",/review/rw9214043/?ref_=tt_urv,"An intriguing character, an historic time, a chance to show what made the man whose name the film bears, squandered on an overbearing visual and audio production. Loud, building, ever-present music, probably to make up for the lack of dramatic dialogue in the script. No family back-story, none of the quirks of his character as a young man, just a series of short episodes in labs while music plays incessantly and too loudly. Jumping back and forth in time, to create a sense of mystery to demonstrate a great man taken down by pettiness. You can't make this movie without hitting some high notes and the test scene brilliant, and the sense of moral regret is well delivered. But the overall production, especially the editing, and the focus on the 'trial' and the decision to omit the early back-story years, creates a gap that is never quite filled, despite the brilliance of Cillian Murphy portraying a man struggling with the impact of what he has unleashed on the world, not to mention a host of fabulous cameos."

I already had a fairly good knowledge of the various characters that were involved in the Manhattan project (i.e., Groves, Fermi, Teller, Bohr, Lawrence, etc.) but I pity anyone who saw this movie without understanding who the characters were in the big picture. I think that Nolan could have put a screen note with the name of the individuals on the screen at the moment, at least, at their first appearance. I was expecting a superficial yet intelligent overview of the science that was involved but the movie did nothing of the sort. The script writer was solely interested in the backroom drama concerning Opperheimer's security clearance. The producer was proudly making it known that no CGi was used in the making of this flick. Unfortunately, this is the one movie that could have benefitted from some serious CGI. I have seen amateur YouTube movies showing amazing home-made CGI nuclear explosions and these would have been much better than the lame gasoline fuelled explosion that was central to the subject matter. The depiction of the Trinity explosion was sorely lacking in size and intensity and it was devoid of the amazing colours and size of the original mushroom cloud.

",/review/rw9200016/?ref_=tt_urv,There's a reason this movie has been kept super under wraps-it's a biography most of all and not even an interesting one. I don't want to spoil but it centers on an event where they don't leave the room. Yes flashbacks and other things happen but this is not epic Christopher Nolan. Extremely disappointing. It's hard to Go on about a movie that really wasn't good but what was most disappointing was the waste of talent. There's a certain oscar winner that is basically a glorified extra until his big moment at the end. It almost felt like Nolan asked his friends to be in a movie and came up with a script after. Don't rush to a theater. Do not recommend.

",/review/rw9324747/?ref_=tt_urv,"I love history but rarely enjoy biopics. Usually they glamorize the person while being overly simplistic. Such is not the case with Oppenheimer. This is a multilayered tale which explores not just what the brilliant man achieved, but how he felt and what he thought. As such, it is a psychological introspective of a man's intellectual, emotional and sexual motivations. The story flashes back and forth between time periods but really isn't difficult to follow. The use of flashbacks effectively illustrate how Oppenheimer's past experiences influence his future actions. The whole story is brilliantly framed by a professional/personal conflict between Oppenheimer and a politically ambitious Lewis Strauss. The film has already been extensively reviewed and lauded so I won't go on. Suffice it to say I highly recommend it."

So here, master director Chris Nolan took on the task of a biopic of Robert Oppenheimer - the ""father of the atomic bomb"". I am sure the movie will get an oscar nod or two. But for this reviewer, it fell short of that lofty mark. First major flaw was the length of the film. It ran THREE HOURS. Yikes. I would almost go so far as to say no movie should run that long. That may go too far, but as to this particular film, the key part of the Oppenheimer life story should have taken 2 hours. Second major flaw, at least in IMAX, was a loud ""boomy"" audio that made dialogue tough to follow. ""Boomy"" bass is fine for atomic test explosions and the like, but not for dialogue. With that said, the quality of acting by Cilian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and others was natural and convincing. I won't fault them."

",/review/rw9265578/?ref_=tt_urv,"Overall a fantastic film, with excellent writing and direction. My main issue lies with its pacing. The events of the story are placed in a none-linear fashion. It's a film that demends your full attention (and probably a couple rewatches), which becomes challenging when you consider its 3 hour-long runtime. Not helping is the fact that for a large part of the film some characters got mixed in my head, however that might be because English isn't my native language, so my attention is split between the actor's face and the subtitles...
Most of this review is negative, and I want to clarify that I did really enjoy the film, I just don't think I have anything new to say about the positives. It's well written, acted, directed and edited. This is a strong recommendation."

In the storyline, Louis Strauss acted as a counterweight to the heroic side of the father of the atomic bomb, and went on to reveal in a one-liner the possibility of a malicious side of the calculating physicist. What undergirds the complexity of the assessment harks back to a witty remark made by Albert Einstein, accompanied by a few amazing shots, that will make things 'click' into place.

There were times when I found it a bit boring as well, especially during the physics and philosophical scenes. As for the negligible parts, removing them wouldn't have been a problem, and in return, the movie would have been a bit shorter, but there was no chance that it would change my view of this masterpiece. The acting and cinematography were not just perfect but some of the best I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few things despite my age.

Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is devastatingly magnificent and is extremely well supported by every single one of the cast including good actors playing small cameos. The sound design was one of the best I have heard in recent times. What impressed me the most was the restraint and subtlety exercised while telling this story. In hands of any other director, this could have very easily become a jingoistic and pathos-inducing average movie. So many of Nolan's stories work because of the emotions and bonds behind all the other stuff but i found that part a bit lacking here and that would be my only critique.

The background score is also very very brilliant. The Nolan has created an absolutely brilliant art, this is story telling at its finest with the background score, with the acting, with the makeup, with the production, with the direction, with the story telling, script writing everything being top notch. Cillian Murphy kills as an oppenhimer and RDJ is also amazing, the last one hour Robert Downey junior kills it, while the first two hours goes to cillian Murphy, and without a doubt the supporting cast is also done an absolutely brilliant job. I particularly Loved the way Nolan has presented the story in such a complexly amazing way. If you can sit for 3 hours with focus and bit of knowledge about the subject (oppenhimer) I am sure you will enjoy the movie to the fullest. I can see some people are not enjoying the movie that much, I think they are lacking some knowledge which revolves around this topic of atomic nuclear bomb, Manhattan project, and oppenhimer.

The story of the atomic bomb deserved better, by dealing with the bombs and their aftermath instead of some historically obscure character's confirmation hearing, and the grilling Oppenheimer received in the closed-door hearing. The film has no soul, does not resound emotionally. There were no build ups, everything just happened. I didn't learn anything I already knew from Youtube videos when preparing to watch the film (certainly nothing about quantum mechanics or the bomb) since I was told about the challenge of following the story, which I hence had no problem following, particularly about the life of Oppenheimer. In the film he is suddenly an acclaimed physicist, then suddenly a leading candidate to lead the Manhattan project, and so on. Poor Cillian Murphy was just there, I didn't feel anything nor cared about the character, his genius and alleged depravity, his guilty conscience. His wife been mad at him for not fighting back ironically applies to the actor's performance in the film. The guy was apparently as boring in real life as in the film.

I had so much ""fun"", not in an amusing way rather in a shocking, emotional one; and I have so much to say about this, as the movie is full with hints and things to analyse, maybe too many things that make the movie too full or on the brink of collapse (that's not the case). We can all agree on the fact that the film was too long or too shallow in action (but not in tension!) as we get very few action sequences in which something is actually going on - with too much exposition that was necessary for the movie to be understood but really still in some parts (but interesting! I'll never call a film boring - this is Christopher Nolan). But I will say that all that exposition and all that building towards the Trinity Test is worth it: I knew what was coming... heart pounding, trembling and freezing hands from anxiety, and I enjoyed every second of it. You can't deny the genius of Nolan, surely not his ability in creating masterpieces. All of that elevated by the amazing score and sound design (a perfect blend really not that common today) that increased my anxiety even more. Surely the film made (and makes) me want to deepen my understanding of quantum physics (not sure if that was the goal of the film... jk). I gotta say, and everyone knows it, that Mr. Cillian Murphy is Oscar-worthy. He is phenomenal. I was him for 3+ hours. I was in his mind. I was there, on the screen, with him. His depiction of J. R. Oppenheimer will stay in my mind for quite some time. And of course the other jewel that stood out, Mr. Downey, that I'm so happy and relieved to finally see in a serious, important, crucial role worth of his caliber. Finally. He really showed what he's about. I'm sure that there are lots of things still to be analysed but I can't get this experience out of my head. I can't seem to think about the flaws but all I see is a great story translated in an amazing cinematic experience, with a crucial message and its warning still echoing in our time.

",/review/rw9249368/?ref_=tt_urv,Nolan has created a cinematic masterpiece with Oppenheimer. At 3 hours it's a tad long even in the comfy imax recliners but it's pretty pretty gripping stuff from start to end. A beautifully shot movie with a superb cast. My only complaint was the soundtrack- why does Nolan insist on putting really loud music in his movies which makes it difficult to hear the dialogue? I had the same complaint with Tenet and it's just not needed for a film like this. Having said that the impact of sound during the bomb test is impressive. Even though I knew it was coming I still nearly pee'd myself when the explosion came!

",/review/rw9208168/?ref_=tt_urv,"Good premise and strong message, but 100 jump cuts and strung out character interviews unfortunately jade the explosive nature of the movie. Great biopic story build-up and general pace for the race against the Nazis and development of the atomic bomb. An allstar cast combined with some great cinematography helped show off modern day movie making capability. However, the last 1/3 of the movie was almost a waste of time, with the exception of the carrot stick Einstein ending. My partner genuinely fell asleep on my shoulder, during the endless questioning of every character in this movie, about what they thought of openhiemer and his connection to communism... Yawn. Many hidden layers and messages in this film which I enjoyed. Many hidden character hidden motives come to light which were mildy interesting. Score was ok.. Although there is no epic tune sticking my head, unlike interstellar or moon for example. Overall I think this movie is a bit overhyped, with people heavily praising Christopher Nolan without justification, definitely not his best work. Cillian Murphy does give a stellar performance... But there's only so many scenes I can take of him staring off-center in conflicting thought. It gets a bit repetitive and 3 hours seemed uneccessary for this story. Overall a good watch if you have interest in the creation of nuclear weapons and particularly the 'opi' man himself. Leave the cinema halfway if you don't enjoy politics and interviews and comi bashing. 6/10."

If this is too much for your cranial bandwidth, go watch Die Hard. Cilian Murphy did an OUTSTANDING job playing a brilliant but tortured physicist. Emily Blunt was amazing as always especially in her testimony on her husband's behalf. A well-told story that takes its time. All-star cast. Gary Oldman makes a brief but important appearance as the narcissistic psychopath war criminal Truman who called Oppenheimer a 'crybaby' for having moral conflicts about designing an instrument that murdered over a quarter of a million innocent human beings. I do wish there would have been much more of a focus on the criminal devastation inflicted upon the people of Japan. Also, deduction for the sex and nudity - WHY do movies do this? Do people enjoy watching depicted sex scenes? If so, why not more scenes of people sitting on toilets? Ridiculous and unnecessary. But all in all a great story.

Where this film really falls down is it's attempt to make the audience feel sorry for the main character during an inquest, given he just helped masacre two civilian cities. That idea is rediculous and an impossible feat. The movie should have ended at the deployment of the weapon and not an attempt to make the audience feel pity for a then rich scientist involved."

",/review/rw9305743/?ref_=tt_urv,"The hype was big for this movie with the cast and having Christopher Nolan overseeing it. It exceeded my expectations. The whole film is very thought provoking, and can lead you into a rabbit hole of different paths of thoughts and research not only into history but science as well. And this history set human kind on a story that is still open-ended. The dialogue is very intelligent and doesn't take time trying to make it seem otherwise. In an already very long movie, I had no issue with googling certain concepts and characters from the movie. Something else that I did not expect although clear from the title. This movie is truly about Oppenheimer not the A-bomb testing leading up to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I found Oppenheimer's character inspiring but in no means perfect. Like real people and real history, stories are nuanced. Although it's easy to absolutely cheer on Oppenheimer against Robert Downey's character, the movie brought up the imperfections in both characters and allowed the audience to form their own opinions on the true motives of both characters. At the end of the movie, both these characters lost, and I hadn't been so shocked by the end of movie since Infinity War (which is funny because completely separate genre). This story is a steppingstone into the Cold War and the conflicts resulting in the current power rankings. War is forever changed. The thought of nukes is hopefully a last resort as we learned of the lingering effects of the first bombings in World War II."

The film is set in the black and white era of the 30's and 40's so why did we need to alternate from black and white to color? A let down in so many areas and gets drawn out to a 3 hour yawn feast.

It's a 3 hour long biopic/political drama about J Robert Oppenheimer and Manhattan Project from the beginning of World War 2 to the Cold War. It's a deep dive into the life and mind of Oppenheimer and the circumstances during that era. Some shots are absolutely breathtaking and I'm surprised that not a single one of them was CGI. A true technical achievement. RDJ was absolutely brilliant in every scene he was in as well as other actors. Everyone was cast perfectly. But the jewel in the crown is without a doubt Cillian Murphy. He embodied the role and stole almost every scene he was in with his sheer scene presence and body language. He's definitely getting nominated and possibly winning best actor for this one.

The majority of the entertainment value of this film is in the beginning leading to the creation of the atomic bomb. Once the bomb is created and tested the rest of the film becomes a bit underwhelming. The aftermath of the attacks on Japan were shared through dialogue and a bit of quirky visuals but nothing truly showing how those people were affected by the bomb.

13 August 2023,9," Telenovela with a bang
",/review/rw9255963/?ref_=tt_urv,"Despite his best efforts, Nolan manages to make an innovative and compelling film about the troubled yet brilliant scientist who led the U. S. effort to build the bomb before its enemies Japan and Germany - and ""ally"" the USSR. At right around a three-hour runtime, Oppenheimer will take you on a kaleidoscopic journey through the life, times and mind of its titular subject. Along the way, three main areas of focus are explored: his personal life; building the bomb; political, philosophical and existential consequences. The two hours focused on his personal life and the consequences could have used a massive shaving on runtime. The middle hour or so actually dealing with the creation of the death-device itself are what really makes and redeems this otherwise bland, saccharin telenovela. The film is further enhanced by the casting of Cillian Murphy, a worthy actor bearing an uncanny resemblance Oppenheimer himself. The cinematography depicting the physical and technical concepts giving us insight into the creation of the infernal machine is a mind-altering experience worthy of the big screen. If you're going to go to the trouble of viewing a film at a theater or Imax, this is your huckleberry. Oppenheimer's dazzling visuals and head-spinning, hardcore scifi intellectual stimulation evoke the classical masters of the genre such as Frank Herbert, Jack Vance, Robert A Heinlein, etc. As a diehard scifi fan, I was even able to forgive the nearly two hours of self-indulgent tripe by deducting only one star. The melodrama, bombast and irrelevancy so tempting and irresistible to Nolan could not withstand the shining brilliance of the film's true core. Bravo Nolan, you're heading in the right direction. Now take some advice from Orson Wells...""it's all in the editing."""

I think it's RDJ's performance that is absolutely magnificent and beyond anything I thought he was capable of. This isn't so much a typical Nolan film, like Interstellar, Inception or Tenet. It is much more a political thriller. It still has great cinematics and audio, but it goes a lot deeper into the psychology of the characters, especially Oppenheimer himself, than characters in other Nolan films. The ensemble of A-list actors in support roles in the film is impressive and all delivered good to great performances, including Matt Damon, an otherwise somewhat one dimensional actor in my opinion.

24 July 2023,6," Biggest Nolan fan, ultimately dissapointed
",/review/rw9211824/?ref_=tt_urv,"After letting the movie marinate in my head for some time, i am dissapointed with it. Plain and simple. I am the biggest Nolan fan (Inception, Interstellar and TDK are in my top 5 all time), and this, plus the fact that almost everyone seems to be putting this movie through the roof, made me go in with more hype than i've had in a long time. Unfortunately, the movie is not what i expected. Not by a long shot. As a big fan of history, plus anything to do with atomic bombs/nuclear power, and everything the trailers led us to believe, i thought Nolan would create a fast paced, time distorted story around some of my favorite topics. Instead, time distorting is what i felt in the last hour of the movie, as it felt as though time was standing still and the movie dragged on until the end. The reason for this is that Nolan focuses 90% of this 3 hour movie on the events outside the creation of the bomb, with long drawn out court/interrogation scenes, making this feel more like a Strauss vs Oppenheimer than about the story of the father of the atomic bomb. For context, i love great dialogue in movies/TV. But this was too much and not interesting enough. The black and white honestly didnt land either. Also, after hearing for months about the explosion scene that Nolan created with no CGI, hearing him say this needed to be seen in Imax, hearing how this movie was gonna be a mindblowing display of sound/visuals, left me all the more dissapointed when the explosion scene lasted no more than 10 minutes. At first when it ended i thought, surely we will see more of it with the bombings of Japan, but no. That was it. Was the point of seeing it in Imax, only for those 10 (albeit great) minutes of the explosion scene? There is no need for Imax for 3 hours of dialogue. I also heard several people in th early screenings talk about a ""horror"" theme to this movie. Maybe those people had just finished watching Barbie and were not being objective. This movie did not have horror themes at all. It barely explores Oppenheimer's feelings after the bombs are released. Instead we see the final hour with more of Strauss vs Oppie. Let me also give some credit where its due. The cinematography, the sound, and the acting were great. Its what we expect of Nolan. But when you strip away all those things and look at only the story, its not great, instead its quite boring. Looking only at the story, i could have been fooled into thinking this was a documentary movie on netflix. Perhaps its on me, for going in with such high expectations for a Nolan movie. If you haven't seen it yet, lower your expectations."

23 July 2023,7," Interesting examination of Oppenheimer but not exciting
",/review/rw9209110/?ref_=tt_urv,This is a 3 hour movie and focus is mainly on Oppenheimer I grew up in the 1950 and I am aware of the historical story of Oppenheimer It is somewhat organized story and trying to do snippets in time events is not a great approach for three hour movie At times it is boring but acting is extremely well done It is not the best movie of the year and trying to call it is an Oscar because of what happened to Oppenheimer is really not interesting. It is sad but is not riveting The basic tenet of any movie should have interesting beginning middle and ending and the ending is probably the most interesting part of the movie Oppenheimer will always be remembered as the man along with Leslie Groves for running the Manhattan project The reality is that story should have focused on the development of the atomic bomb and men who created it and the struggles they had I found the movie with Paul Newman about Leslie Groves more interesting than this movie in certain aspects. In this era I think very few people would be interested to know what happened to Oppenheimer Also trying to look at what happened to him in the 1950 from a perspective of the 21st century is also flawed because of the adversary of the Cold War In reality Oppenheimer did give somewhat conflicting testimony as regards to certain events Of course he will be also regarded a hero and certainly was not a communist sympathizer by any means and loyal to his country He is a remarkable man who brought this project to success Cilian Murphy gave an outstanding performance and in some ways his personality personifies Oppenheimer (Does he ever smile in real life.)

The main issue with the movie is bad editing or story telling. Especially in the beginning there are too many storylines at once, that are not properly ordered or put together. They could have used one of the story lines as the framing. And they do that later in the movie with the kangaroo court, but that is mising in the beginning, where we just get random cuts to four or five different timelines, where half of them are in black and white, to make them visually distinct, but often it is the future or the framing that is in black and white,making it rather disjointed."

I did NOT like the disjointed storyline and it felt like they left out so much of Oppenheimer's actual story. We see him at college and then at his great Atomic bomb building level. Story alludes to his greatness but not why. Also left out his wife's bio completely and in real life he got grief for that. Timelines were wonky too... made story hard to follow. Oh and they completely left out pearl harbor and the pivot to bombing Japan vs the original idea to use it on Hitler. Was also very long....they had ample time to tell the story but it was shown as more of a collage of times and events. Was it worth a watch? I think so. If only to bring up the conversation and go home and research everything. Cillian's portrayal was great tho...acting in this was really superb and believable."

",/review/rw9203663/?ref_=tt_urv,"I was excited for this film and saw the first possible showing in my area. I was hoping to love it but I did not. Nolan's visual virtuosity is obvious it certainly featured a great performance by Irish star Cilian Murphy as Oppenheimer. It was not a surprise that Nolan did not follow a linear timeline and even utilized some sequences in black and white although for a much different reason than in Memento. The problem is any story about the Manhattan Project always has to deal with the large number of characters and the multi threaded timeline mostly just made it more confusing. Feynman was included as a very shallow character only to show his real life decision to watch the Trinity Test through a car windshield and not use the safety glasses like everyone else. I would have liked to see more of WW2 unfolding as I believe there was a lot of fear of Hitler obtaining the bomb first and somehow that urgency to me was not conveyed. They did not specifically cover Pearl Harbor but of course the bomb was eventually dropped on Japan as Germany had already been defeated before the bomb was complete. I believe there was good coverage on the issue of whether the bomb actually needed to be used in the circumstances, something people still argue about today. It was definitely a very good movie and Matt Damon was excellent as General Groves who was in charge of the Manhattan Project from the military point of view and essentially was Oppenheimer's boss. I would have liked a bit more about the many technical challenges the scientists overcame as I believe one of the larger themes of this history is great scientists solving incredibly challenging problems only to wonder whether the result was entirely of negative value."

I absolutely loved the movie, the intensity, the fascination, the contrast between curiosity and ambition and interest in how the universe works vs the realisation of the monster they've created. It really is incredible how this inner agony has been portrayed and honestly I've never been let down by Nolan. I'm a huge fan. Tenet was the least good for me tbh. But what a come back... I watched it on IMAX and as soon as it ended I literally thought ""I have to watch this again"". 3 hours felt like 30 minutes. Very fast paced which made the political side of it seem not so boring. I also enjoyed the fact that it was 2 stories wrapped into one. On the one hand we get the feelings inside cylians character (btw awesome work, Oscar worthy for me) and the other, the more political and ""fame"" side of Oppenheimer's struggle when he was let down and discarded by he's own country that he loved. I adored it, already one of my all time favourites. The cinematography is absolutely ridiculous. The soundtrack is majestic and disturbing at the same time.

",/review/rw9206485/?ref_=tt_urv,"If you expect the usual from a Nolan's movie - some mind-blowing, hard to even explain plot, that's not the case. With Oppenheimer he relied on different approach of writing and directing, which I guess it's understandable bearing in mind the subject and the genre. I could even sense at moments Scorsese+Spielberg vibe(don't really know how to prove this statement, just really reminded me of their style in some of their works). Of course, he kept his uniqueness(different but interlinked timelines, importance of every word and action in the big picture and etc.) by adapting it to the needs of an epic about true fundamental historical events."
23 July 2023,7," Engrossing, enervating
",/review/rw9209340/?ref_=tt_urv,"An American-British biopic thriller; A story about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, appointed to develop and design the atomic bomb. After his scientific team's work comes to fruition he faced the consequences of speaking truth to power. This is an ambitious character study epic with big scope and spectacle. It relies on a tour de force from Cillian Murphy who harnesses the anguish, guilt, gloom, and haughtiness of the title character in a layered performance. The optics captivate, which it must, and it haunts, as it should, given the enormity of real-life events and it is brilliant in showing how ambition and morality can end up in silos. Despite its meticulous, fact-based psychodrama it is a broad story with strong visuals and sound design. Exposition was critical for the plot so great minds of the age who had varied involvement in the arms race were introduced. But the first 45 minutes played out like a long film trailer with biographical detail that was often clunky. Eventually a hiatus in the musical score led the way for suspense to build to a gripping centrepiece sequence whereon the director's expertise in choreography was evident. Films which are dialogue-heavy can assuage the feeling of being overwrought by using montages which help with the viewing experience. The absence of this at times worked to the film's detriment. Long feature films need to earn emotional engagement too. The male-female narrative seemed curtailed and the third hour's pacing was at times enervating with its long legal meetings and political scrapping. Overall, a bold, fascinating film about a complicated legacy with many strong supporting performances, but it was dizzy and occasionally clotted in delivery."

It uses constant music and sound effects that could be best described as noise. The visual effects are sometimes a little strange and abstract. The nudity is pretty gratuitous, I guess because a prestige picture can't be rated PG13.

The story is portrayed in an incredible, tense and dynamic way. I like the fact that it is dynamic because it manages to hold the viewer well even in moments that would be calmer or even a little boring in other stories, but here everything is done very well for you to hold. One thing that helps to keep you hooked is the incredible interpretation of the actors, giving life and high realism to their characters and I especially highlight Cillian Murphy who is the soul of Oppenheimer. The film manages to convey the feeling of the scene very well, especially seconds before the explosion, making us feel in the protagonist's shoes and what helps is the fact that Nolan has not used any CGI the whole film, so it makes us anxious for the result as well as Oppenheimer and his co-workers."

If you are a cinema lover, you are going to enjoy this masterpiece.

",/review/rw9207340/?ref_=tt_urv,"Before I say my opinion, many people thought that the movie was classified as dynamic and expected fighting scenes, and so on. This is a grave mistake. The movie is a biography, all of it on Robert Oppenheimer. A conversational experience that is one of the most enjoyable. This is the strength of the movie. It is the language of dialogue between the actors. This is the basis of the movie. Not to mention the scenes of the nuclear bomb, which I classify as one of the best scenes that I could have seen in my life, the powerful acting, and more than expected from Robert Downey Jr. The whole experience is more than wonderful, and we must not forget the soundtrack from heaven, and I expect an Oscar for this music."

20 July 2023,10," Is it on Top 3 films by Nolan?
",/review/rw9203230/?ref_=tt_urv,"With Oppenheimer, Nolan has created the perfect cinematic cocktail. Outstanding soundtrack, photography, actors and script, all these things that make up the cocktail are worth an Oscar. The performance of each of the actors is impressive, they all create a perfect tune that catches you in the plot. Expectations were extremely high with Cillian Murphy's performance, however he has been able to far exceed them with a superb performance. I have rarely seen an actor interpreting a historical character in such a deep way, in which for a moment you forget that it is Cillian and you really think that you are seeing Oppenheimer on the big screen. This gives a great added value to the film. In my opinion, Oppenheimer falls into Nolan's top 3 films, ranking it in the first place would be somewhat pretentious having only seen it once. Without any doubt in the following weeks I will return to the cinema to see this masterpiece again."

",/review/rw9232481/?ref_=tt_urv,"I enjoyed the film, I knew a little bit about the Manhattan project but not much and I now feel I've learnt something historically and also in the very here and now which is scary. A very talented roster of actors with some cameos and brilliant performances from both Murphy and Downey Jr, I hated the latter in this film which just proves how good he is as I love him in most of his films. But I can't help but feel it was disjointed flicking back and forth between before, during and after. Other than the 2 mentioned actors the other characters don't make much of an impact, I felt like I'd watched about 4 genres rolled into 1 and there wasn't enough in about the actual bomb itself. Interesting film but it felt as if the different aspects of the storyline were all competing with each other as opposed to bringing the main focus of the film together. Not my favourite Nolan film."
8 August 2023,9," Oppenheimer is a history lesson with adult themes
",/review/rw9247386/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie is not about a hero. J. Robert Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist who raised Einstein's theory about quantum physics to the point where it could be used to produce an atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy as Dr. Oppenheimer is absolutely perfect in this title role. I enjoyed watching his brilliant talent while acting the various complexities about this historical character who is a flawed human being but, with his intuitive intelligence, became responsible for leading the World War II secret Manhattan Project and launching the world into the atomic age. I learned a lot of history by watching this film, although some scenes were surprisingly adult and unanticipated in the roll out of the plot. Robert Downey Jr., was exceptionally well cast as the difficult character Lewis Strauss who was a political man who, in my opinion, would have been lost to history without Downey's superb portrayal. Oppenheimer is a movie that will generate a renewed historical interest, and ethical discussions about how the atomic age transformed world politics and impacted the earth's environment."

His story is important and should be told. The all-star cast showed up, performing to their expected levels. I particularly enjoyed Matt Damon's character, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. He was a hard-nosed, witty, no nonsense, Pattonesque general. I learned some things about the development of the atom bomb that I didn't know previously. The cinematography and the movie period atmosphere were authentic enough, however, I was not as blown away by the film as I expected to be. There were many characters, names, story lines that were a bit befuddling at times, taking awhile to learn them all. The way the movie went back and forth in at least three different periods of Oppenheimer's atomic bomb development endeavor, which involved sections of black and white filming, then going back to another period in color, was at times, somewhat discombobulating. The movie was also 1/2 - 1 hour too long. I think the same story could've been told in a shorter period of time. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the movie, but it did not strike emotion in me as some of my favorites have. I'm sure the academy will love it. I'm just not ready to give it Best Picture - yet."

Strauss later tried to undermine him simply because he didn't want to give Oppenheimer so much credit. Other topics such as competition with the Nazis, how the bomb was made, Oppenheimer's relationship with Eisenstein, and his love life are only briefly touched upon. There is a continuous musical score accompanied by overwhelming sound effects to alleviate the boredom. You are relieved when things become slightly clearer at the end what is the focus of the movie and especially that the film is finely over."

",/review/rw9221605/?ref_=tt_urv,"I believe that we must distinguish the film and the story. The events that inspired this movie are tremendously important and fascinating; but the film itself is a fiasco. First, it is far too long. The first half is a classic portrait of a scientist working on a project. It has nothing outstanding from a cinematic point of view. I had to wait an hour and a half before seeing anything inspired and inspiring. Then, there's the sound: the constant presence of music or sound effects drowns the dialogues and is really, really irritating, while serving a presumably dramatic purpose. The camera work is shallow and uninspired, at best: definitely not what one would expect in a film presented as a great piece of cinema. Fortunately, the actors do a first-class job throughout all this mediocrity."

However, this movie, either by design or unintentionally is not as gripping or thrilling as other Nolan movies. Perhaps, the audience should have expected this given that it was marketed as a biopic. But, still, with Nolan at the helm, I expected more suspense. The stakes of the Manhattan project were existential, yet that feeling of existentialism was lacking throughout the film. Cillian Murphy's performance was masterful, but I don't feel that I learned anything of substance about the subject he was portraying."

I feel that Mr. Nolan got caught in that same bog, and the film suffers a bit as a result. The rest of the film is brilliant, and might have come in better at the 160 minute mark. The dialogue in the first half was also unfortunately blared out by the soundtrack. I saw it in XD. A good watch for history buffs interested in the beginnings of the Cold War."

Fission, which covers Oppenheimer's rise in the 1940s, as head of the Manhattan Project, creating the first atom bomb. And Part 2.

Insanely tense, dramatic, with masterful acting; literally not a single misstep. The writing is somehow at a breakneck pace throughout the whole thing, simply because there is so much to cover, but the density doesn't dilute the film in any way.

11 August 2023,6," Good, but not that good
",/review/rw9253084/?ref_=tt_urv,"While Christopher Nolan is a superb director, the film did little for me. That may be because of my age. I found the 1980 BBC miniseries ""Oppenheimer"" starring Sam Waterston as the famous scientist better written, better acted, and much more informative than the current film. Having said that, Nolan's film, no doubt, will be popular and informative for the younger generations which have shorter attention spans, aversions to a TV series produced four decades ago, and probably little knowledge of what it was like to grow up under the threat of nuclear annihilation. The current film tries to cover three segments of Oppenheimer's life: his younger years, the Los Alamos/Trinity segment of the Manhattan Project, and his persecution after WWII because of his communist ties. All three segments are sort of shuffled together like a poker deck between hands. The intercutting, while done well, is often jarring and confusing, but that is the hand dealt to feature film producers since they must stuff their work into the time slots allotted to them by theater owners. The miniseries, like a novel, allows the story to be stretched out in more lifelike proportions. Much has been said about the use of 70mm film, and even the producers suggested this large format added to the majestic nature of the subject matter, which by any standard is epic. However, the technical aspects of the film, while adding eye candy to the production, did little for the Oppenheimer story, which is epic in its own right. Large parts of the dialogue were difficult to decipher, a common problem with today's motion picture and television productions. Diction is no longer an essential aspect of the art form, having fallen to the god of realism rather than articulation. And the music was nothing short of banal, with an overpowering mix that got in the way of the story and the film. In short it was unimaginative and too loud, like Dick Wolf's more recent television productions such as his ""Chicago"" franchise.

I always liked Nolan's work, but this one cemented me as viewing him as a great filmmaker period, and not just a great blockbuster filmmaker. The script is extremely sharp and the stand out performance is Cillian Murphy who really puts his heart into the role. It does not feel like 3 hours and even though I knew a lot of the story, it was still very engaging and enjoyable. This one honestly rivals Memento and The Dark Knight for me as Nolan's greatest achievement. I would say it's even better than the Batman trilogy because the script is so much sharper.

Without giving away much, maybe I expected a balanced view of Oppenheimer's ambitions and his humanity but this was not to be.

Cillian Murphy delivered one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. He deserves to be claimed as one of the best actors of our time, and he deserves his flowers for this performance. With that being said I was truly blown away by Robert Downey Jr performance as Lewis Strauss. He is absolutely remarkable in this role and knocks it out of the park.

He is a good director, because he choose the right actors, acting itself is great, everyone does a great job. Also locations and set design, the look, editing and cinematography are great. But in my opinion all of his recent films lack focus. He always tries to squeeze to much into the story and does not ""kill his darlings"". The writing is just not good, too much dry exposition. Often times charakters telling each other things they already know. Oppenheimer, even though he is in almost every scene, keeps a stranger to us. I could not disrcibe his character, since we only have external things happening to him. The exeption might be the hall scene, where the crowd cheers him after the bomb was used against japan.

I thought the sound, the acting, the visuals were brilliant, but until the part in the movie where the bomb is tested and then everything afterwards, I was just lost. Ok here's the good part and why I gave the movie 8 stars and maybe I might change it to a 10 someday.. I believe that I will thoroughly love this movie the second time I watch it, and that's because it will all make sense. The last 30 minutes explained the first 2 hours, so next time I watch it, the first 2 hours will make sense. I truly hope RDJ finally gets his Oscar for this movie, but honestly it could go to anyone in this cast, even the small role from Rami Malek was Oscar worthy. I'm going to go again with hubby, so hopefully I'll enjoy it a bit more than last time."

",/review/rw9205389/?ref_=tt_urv,"After his last outing Tenet, which wasn't as well received, Nolan decided to venture a biography. Oppenheimer is very different from all the movies Nolan has attempted before, deviating from his SciFi orgasm and moving towards reality and grounded cinema. It could be a recency bias from my end, but I think Oppenheimer is quite possibly Nolan's best movie till date. It's a culmination of all the things Nolan attempted in his prior movies: the cinematography, the sound, the bgm, the screenplay; everything just works in a perfect culmination. The BGM of this movie makes the scenes erupt with tension and add a different perspective altogether. The tension created esp in the scene where the bomb is tested is just an iconic scene altogether. It's so brilliantly shot and executed that words cannot do justice to it. Another iconic scene is where Cilian gives his celebratory speech, which shows what an intelligent filmmaker Nolan is. The actors are amazing with their roles. Cilian and Robert Downey just steal the show overall. Although it's 3 hours long, but you're so engaged in this movie, thanks to the brilliant screenplay with Nolan who juggles with so much content, yet executes it brilliantly, that this movie never feels like a bore. One of the finest movies to come out of Hollywood and it deserves a watch. A Must Watch."

I witnessed this today in theater, and I gotta say, what an experience that was! The story was simple and yet very complicated. The story is supposedly the biopic of the famous American nuclear-physicist J Robert Oppenheimer before, during and after the WW2, and yet every incidents are complicated in their own ways, and every person are unique and complex, just like every literal human-being. Everyone has their personal goals to achieve, everyone has their personal world-view, everyone has their mistakes, setbacks and realizations, and everyone has their insecurities and deep-lying flaws. The character developments and arcs and the on-screen chemistries between the characters were very satisfying to watch. Even every minor or side characters got their moment to shine. The BGM was splendid, and the screenplay was definitely one of the finest I've seen in recent years. In fact, this is the type of subtle and mature storytelling that I love so dearly. And when the movie was over, I had a smile on my face, cause I've known instantly that I've experienced something that I haven't before."

Robert Oppenheimer told in a brilliant and fantastically visceral story, seen through the masterful eyes of visionary writer/director Christopher Nolan. And Murphy is nothing less than stellar. Breathtaking. The way Nolan manages to cast a fantastic roster of brilliant actors to meet this ""first person shooter"" of a movie is a piece of art in itself, all done to support the burden that Murphy had. As with most of his films, ""time"" is overly present in the naration and the writer/director lets us figure out who, what and when in brilliant and relatively easy to get way. The editing is fantastic, by the way. Some of the scenes are presented as too exaggerated and a bit too dramatic, with an overly powerful music score that seems as an overkill at times, so they can be a bit tiring. Having said that, the ""Trinity"" scene (please see the film to figure the scene out, no spoilers here) is a tension building scene that has, probably, no equal in the not so recent movie history. It will be remembered as one
of the most dramatic and superbly executed scenes of all time. Seriously. Not only that, but a subsequent ""speech"" scene is equally visceral, to the core. To sum it all up, you should not miss this piece of art and, please see it on an IMAX screen, as the director intended."

Again, quality acting is present but the length got to me for sure. It felt like the movie was four hours instead of three and it caused me to sometimes get bored. Also, way too much background music which got kind of annoying in my opinion. The only other Christopher Nolan movie I have seen is Dunkirk, and I think it was a little better than this movie.

That's the only positive thing i have to say about this boring garbage. All the cameos are out of place along with the sex scenes. Nolan should never be allowed to cast another movie. He got lucky with Heath Ledger. If you liked this movie then you're pretentious and a sucker. 20 year old documentaries on the subject are more interesting.

Along with robert downey jr, who initially i thought it would be hard to unlink the iron man image after more than 10 years of marvel, but he delivers something amazing too. The film's script is very dense and challenging, nolan is very criticized by the public for explaining too much ""obvious"" things in his films, as if he was underestimating the public. This does not apply here, oppenheimer's script requires a lot of attention from start to finish, at a certain point it can get tiring due to its 3h duration, however, it is something that the public will have to weigh whether this is a worthwhile experience or not, it is totally personal. Oppenheimer is a film that i will definitely watch again after studying more about the subject, the film managed to awaken my interest in studying about the life of the physicist and the manhattan project, and also to go after the work on which nolan was based to do it. In technical terms the film is perfect, yes, perfect. There is simply nothing to say about the technical part, it is an example, it is pure cinema, it is incredible what is done here, all the ambience created, photography and especially the sound part, audio is always used during the film as part of immersing the story, which was a perfect decision."

I was especially interested in the efforts made to destroy Oppenheimer's reputation after the war and applaud Robert Downey's Academy Award level performance. My reason for rating this film lower than I had hoped to rate it is the sound track. Three of us found it difficult to clearly hear the cast members because of either distortion in the recording or masking level ambient noise in the film. The use of ""airy"" voices that has become so prevalent in todays films is infuriating. It is as if the use of vocal cords in the uttering of speech is now forbidden. I kept wanting to shout out ""SPEAK UP"". SAY IT SO WE CAN HEAR YOU!"" Finally, the use of extreme noise levels in this film was far, far overdone. For an atomic bomb explosion? OK. But the use of room jarring, earth shaking low frequency sound levels over and over again was both gratuitous and ridiculous.

I strongly beleive that a movie about the scientist who played a key role in the creation of the atomic bomb should unquestionably emphasize on the consequences of this invention and send strong peaceful messages to the audience! Especially in the world we live in today! However, it looks like in the new movie Oppenheimer they almost ignore the tragic facts that hundreds of thousands of innocent people died from the first 2 bombs and that the whole world changed after Oppenheim's invention, which was obviously the biggest drama in this one human being's life. They emphasize and build the story in the movie around the fact that Oppenheimer was later accused of being a spy of the Soviets (who were allies to the Americans in WW2...)."

Christopher Nolan has never made a bad film and this is probably his best directed film. Every shot is beautiful. The music by Ludwig Göransson is one of the best ever put to screen. It adds so much tension to every single scene. Cillian Murphy is excellent as Oppenheimer. He adds so much personality to the character and it portrays him as a deeply flawed, but brilliant and important person in human history. The standout here is Robert Downey Jr. He gets to show all of his acting chops in this movie and it is by far his finest work. His character doesn't share a lot of screen time with Oppenheimer but every scene RDJ's character is on screen the rage he builds is believable thanks to one of the best actors of the 21st century.

That type of structure allows the film to jump around in time, following the impacts of a decision throughout his life. Jumping around is definitely Nolan's directing style. It keeps the pacing fast, and helps to parse out portions of the film that would have otherwise become static if told in linear fashion. This is the case of the hearing. It is conducted in a small and uninteresting room as a location. Same for the many many conversations about being engaged in politics."

22 July 2023,10," Not for everyone!
",/review/rw9206042/?ref_=tt_urv,"See, Oppenheimer is a movie which is about the late scientist's life J Robert Oppenheimer. The story is completely based on his life and nothing's changed from it, if you're expecting an entertainer or a subtle of impressing moments then it's not a cup of tea for everyone. We all know that Nolan's movies like The Batman Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, Prestige, Tenet and many more movies like that is kinda entertaining, but the point to be noted here is, the movie is entirely different from these movies i've mentioned. From an honest reaction as a movie lover, not as a Nolan fanboy. The first half is literally boring i ain't gonna lie about that. But from the second half the movie completely changes things becomes impressive. But what i understood from this movie is, if you miss a single scene from this movie. You'll get confused as hell. Because one of my friend who came with me was yawning and slept for some minutes. He couldn't keep up with the movie. And I've seen the movie twice first i saw it in an IMAX screen and second i saw it in a normal 4K ATMOS screen. The explosion scenes were pretty good in IMAX compared to the normal, so i wanna say is, if you want a great experience, IMAX is the best choice than 4DX. And if you are expecting Oppenheimer to be a entertaining movie like other Nolan movies then you are wrong. And if you watch with that taste or a mindset you'll feel so embarrassed and will leave the theatre asap."

The ""hearing"" where his security clearance is NOT renewed his a kangaroo court in the extreme. The only consolation you feel for him is when Robert Downey Jr's character gets knocked back too. You understand how someone realised later how wrong this act was (for Oppenheimer) and posthumously restored it, but only in 2022. Still, these are small points. Great cast and great story. Locations used very well, making you realise the existence at Los Alamos was pretty grim."
22 July 2023,9," ENERGY, PARADOX, AND CHAOS
",/review/rw9207030/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan's latest masterpiece, Oppenheimer narrates the most horrifying historical truth and an exceptional scrutiny. Robert Oppenheimer acts under a purely genius mind to build the atomic bomb, focusing merely on theory with paying almost no attention to the deadly consequences. In the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki apocalypse, he makes his best to clear his conscience. Oppenheimer stands out as one of the most important films of this season. There may be a single flaw comes along with Nolan's choice of nonlinear story telling which mixes the power of the catharsis effect. Nevertheless giving Christopher Nolan's filmography, we are lucky to have such brilliant director following the paths of Kubrick."

I watched these two films together (started with Barbie and then Oppenheimer) and wholeheartedly speaking Barbie comes on top (there was depth to the characters, the performances were amazing, the storyline brilliant, the emotions and humor tugged at your heartstrings). The same cannot be said for Oppenheimer. The film was good, not amazing but good. The cinematography was fantastic, performances brilliant. However, at 3 hours long the film did not keep my attention, if anything I fell asleep only to wake up towards the middle of the movie which is why I'm giving my score of 7/10. The storyline dragged, the characters were written well but were tiring to watch at times. I would say wait for the film to come out on Apple TV and rent it from there."

This is a perfect biopic.

The pacing was excellent. It's a pretty solid bet that this will take home many trophies on Oscar night. For me, the sure winner will be Robert Downey Jr. For his nuanced portrayal of Strauss. Well worth seeing on the big screen."
24 July 2023,10," A master work from a master director.
",/review/rw9212363/?ref_=tt_urv,"There came a point about midway into this film where my lungs began to hurt really bad. And then, not long after, I felt my whole body lurch and gasp for air. Turns out, I had quit breathing. That was how tense and on edge I was. Oppenheimer is a lot of movie to take in. At times, moments feel unnecessarily long and slow, but I believe that those things truly pale in comparison to the things this film does so well. For one, the casting choices are sensational. Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer will be remembered as one of the greatest casting choices in cinema. And of course, the rest of the cast reads like a who's who of Hollywood elite, and they provide incredible performances of their own. Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, Gary Oldham, and more. It's exceedingly rare having this level of talent in one movie. The sound design and cinematography of this movie is also Oscar worthy in every sense. The ticking of Geiger counters, Murphy's awed breathing as he watches the rolling flames in the aftermath of the atomic bomb's detonation, the camera flashes, it all pairs so well together. Oppenheimer is a film that must be experienced as much with the ears as much as the eyes. And, of course, the thing that Oppenheimer does best is how it supplants the audience in the shoes of its titular character. There are several moments throughout this film where it's hard to distinguish the feelings of the man on screen and the audience watching him. The weight of decisions he makes is felt on and off the screen. You can feel the burden that's on his shoulders as the implications of his achievements become clear. Oppenheimer is one of the most complicated men in all of history and Christopher Nolan has managed to tell his story for a new audience in a way that is sympathetic, honest, and prophetic. It is not a happy movie by any means, nor should it be. The life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of tragedy, not just personally, but for the legacy he is now fixed to. Through him, man has harnessed the power to create destruction on a mass scale. The man himself is gone, but his legacy remains to bear witness to both the limitless possibilities of science, and its consequences. This is an important film, and it needs to be viewed as often. A masterpiece in every sense."

These are two tag lines from Christopher Nolan's excellent Bio-pic, Oppenheimer, which I saw yesterday. Perhaps the best and most important film made in the last 100 years That is to say, ever! Must see in IMAX! Highest quality, both for sound and visuals. The acting was superb. Cillian Murphy was excellent as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. Gave perhaps the best performance of his career. One should never forget two things. There are warring nations on Earth right now that have nuclear weapons capable of destroying the world and wiping out civilization. And the other thing is The United States is the only country in the world to drop an atomic bomb on another country. The targets were cities populated by civilians. It is debatable whether this heinous act saved lives or ended the war. But one thing for sure is that tens of thousands of people were instantaneously incinerated and thousands more died of radiation poisoning.

Dunkirk, Tenet, Interstellar are all masterpieces and who can forget Momento. All that said, it brings me no joy to write a negative review for a film that is technically so well done and whose performances are so vivid. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. Did an amazing job in their perspective roles, but the film has a glaring problem. A giant atom bomb sized problem. Oppenheimer completely dodges the morality of vaporizing more than 100,000 lives. More screen time is given to Oppenheimer's love interests and whether or not he's a communist sympathizer and it just feels like Nolan is scared to tackle the real elephant in the room. While this may be Nolan's attempt to not trivialize the deaths of so many Japanese civilians, makes the film truly a tragedy when you see such an opportunity squandered. Barbie was a far braver film from that standpoint. In Inception, Dunkirk, and Tenet we have obscured or almost faceless villains. It's a theme with Nolan to focus on his protagonist. In the case of Oppenheimer he under plays the trauma that the real Oppenheimer must have felt when he saw films of the destruction he had caused. The real Oppenheimer seemed to be deeply effected and that humanity simply doesn't get enough screen time to make this an impactful film."

Do not go into this expecting a typical Christopher Nolan film like the dark knight or inception, this is telling the story of Oppenheimer and his life and development of the bomb.

I have to give it ti Mr Nolan, he has created yet again, another masterpiece of a film. I also should point out the music. As much as I thin Hans Zimmer is one of the greatest composers, Ludwig Göransson couldn't have done a better job than he did on Oppenheimer. The score mad meme feel ways I have never felt before, and the build up to the trinity test was an experience I wish I could endure again for the first time.

",/review/rw9234560/?ref_=tt_urv,"Having forced myself to sit through ""Interstellar"" (2014), I was forewarned that this Auteur was more committed to the arty than to art. This episodic movie offers random scenes from the life of the father of the atom bomb at a very important historical moment. President Joe Biden has announced that we are at the brink of ""Nuclear Armageddon,"" so this is a worthy contribution to a rich genre that began with Arch Obler's ""Five"" (1951). Its major virtue is the portrayal of the ant-Communist hysteria of the 1940s, which preordained the present anti-Maga hysteria, both crazes united in their conviction that nuclear war with Russia is probably inevitable, especially now that Russian agents, pretending to be Americans, are among us. The brief portrait of the diminutive haberdasher from Independence is highly amusing. Movie directors are tyrants on the set and in the theatres, where they may require 180 minutes of undivided attention, but, here, it's worth a sitting."

Because it was not worth it. I was in row H and I kept walking up and up the stairs and it was the very top row. So I don't feel I got any benefit of seeing it in IMAX as I was that far away from the screen. The movie itself: so extremely boring. What was the point of it? To show how Oppenheimer was persecuted in the 50s over Communism? Who wasn't? Big deal. I could not wait for it to be over. It was hard to follow what was going on with so many characters. It took a lot of concentration to follow what was going on and all we wanted to see was the explosion. The only plus of this movie was seeing what was under those taped spots on the test bomb (and I'm not telling because that was the only interesting part of this movie). What a waste of 3 hours. Read all about it on Wikipedia and save your money. It's not worth it. But I am sure it will win lots of Oscar's. The boring movies always do.

The cast, the effects the sound, I specifically watched the movie in Imax, which made the experience a lot more better with the sound and the big screen, Cillian Murphy's performance in the movie was insane. It just felt so real. I think. Cillian and Christopher definitely deserves a oscar for this movie. When I watched the movie it didn't felt at all like a 3h one minute I got into the cinema and one minute the movie has ended. Actually I didn't accept for the movie to be so good. Before the movie I thought it would suck like a movie I've watched a few months ago, I just left this movie before a half hour of it, but in Oppenheimer it was different, the act of all the cast was insane. The effects were so good and realistic. And the sound literally blow my mind. As soon as the movie has come out I told my friend ""we are going to this movie, whether you want to or not."" He also thought the movie was great, I think it is definitely deserve a watch. But I gave it 9/10 because Nolan could make it shorter in my opinion, but without the 3h the movie is definitely a 10/10 even with the fact the movie is 3 hours, it is definitely deserves a watch!.

It's not a movie about the atomic bomb, but about how one man was able to build the greatest monster in human history. The film shows that truth is a matter of interpretation and that genius is not necessarily the same as wisdom. Moral dilemma and political calculation are the focus here. The film manages without any action and builds its tension mainly through the jumping back and forth in the different time levels, as well as the unbelievable sound design. Unfortunately, the end lacks the necessary depth and insight into Oppenheimer's character and his motivations. Unfortunately, the film didn't convince me in the end, but it's still worth seeing."

I remember when Inception was released and there were mixed responses from the audience from ""Absolutely brilliant"" to ""What on Earth did I just watch?"" I love this about Nolan. His movies are designed to make us ask questions, to make us use our brains. We have become lazy in our viewing of entertainment. We want action packed explosions and everything handed on a plate and tied up in a little bow at the end. This is not that. Acting performances were superb from all parties. It is a theatrical, cinematic masterpiece. This movie is not about Oppenheimer being put on trial. This movie is about humanity being put on trial. It's a movie that needs to be watched more than once, like all Nolan movies, to truly be able to take in all of the amazing creativity, writing, music and acting. Is it essential to view in IMAX? Perhaps not. But, I really think this movie is something to be experienced, not to just be watched. That is what makes cinema special. Cinema isn't just watching a movie, it's experiencing a movie.

But it justifies its name and makes sure it revolves around the Man who created it all in the first place and about his internal battles and psyche and it does that beautifully, by revolving in different timelines but still managing the constant tension in the movie is so great.

It's a shame that nobody involved in the making of this film looked at actual footage. And it's not like there isn't enough of it about either, so there's no excuse. The story of Oppenheimer is ok.

",/review/rw9216156/?ref_=tt_urv,"Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the ""Manhattan Project"" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious ""Col. Groves"" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event ""enquiries"" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch."

Even 20 minutes into it, I was thinking 'this has got to get better, right?' Only it never does. The dialog is difficult to hear (largely over the loud music that never stops), and the storyline is not easy to follow. But besides all this, it's just a shockingly boring movie.

Of course Cillian Murphy was brilliant as Oppenheimer, his performance is truly what kept me engaged throughout those 3 hours. I really liked the cinematography as well, Nolan did a great job at communicating both the beauty and horror of the atomic bomb.

",/review/rw9203095/?ref_=tt_urv,"While there was barely dialogue and mostly action in ""Dunkirk"", Nolan took almost the opposite approach for ""Oppenheimer"". The (for Nolan) unusual amount of dialog scenes are handled surprisingly well and allows most of the cast to really shine. Cillian Murphy gives, in my opinion, the best performance in a Nolan movie since Heath Ledger. Benny Safdie surprised me his fantastic portrait and Robert Downey Jr. Really proved his chops as a charismatic actor who can also go deep."

I found the editing work to be amazing, and I really hope it will be nominated for the Oscars for that. The casting is fabulous, the direction is grandiose, Cillian Murphy is superb, and the music and sound design are outstanding. All the images illustrating the quantum world are magnificently illustrated by a sound design that will give you chills. The Trinity sequence puts you in a crazy tension. I can't wait to see it again to fully grasp all its aspects, and the ending leaves you speechless."

He can take a character, event, and story and make an incredible film so rich with detail, great cinematography, and incredible acting that make you feel like you're part of the actual story. Watching Oppenheimer made me feel like I understood quantum mechanics, something I obviously do not. Watching Oppenheimer go from promising physics student to ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"" is probably one of the best cinema journeys I have ever been on. Cillian Murphy truly puts on a career best performance.

Massive cast with familiar faces throughout the film. Robert Downey Jr. Does an intimidating performance while having his known charm. The music in this film was a massive highlight even without composer Hans Zimmer. Christopher Nolan constantly shows he knows how to pull out the greatest performances from his actors and why they always want to work with him. Highly recommend this film even if you are not interested in biopics. This is something else. Must watch film in Theaters.

But what you would find your yourself is that after the movie your brain is gonna go crazy. Crazy because the topic, the execution and sequence of how Nolan presented what was a real life event and the consequences of it that we inherited today is gonna make you think a lot. I can easily say that many movies can be excellent, but only few can be exceptional and Oppenheimer is one of them. Watch it on cinema IMAX, and please do leave some time to think about the last words of that movie, maybe after all art can change the world through each one of us."

",/review/rw9221661/?ref_=tt_urv,"At least three different timelines, intricately interwoven. Black-and-white and color sequences, numerous flashbacks, rapid transitions between the scenes. A complicated, probably even impossible task for the most regisseurs and script writers. Not for Christopher Nolan. He does it on everyday basis. He did it even more stunningly. One can think of Tenet, Prestige, Memento...
Firstly, it is a drama at its finest. Scientists are not too different from other people, after all, and often have the very same problems in their professional and family life. By no means are they always asexual bookworms. And even being the best physicists in the world, they can be extremely naïve. Several decades ago, they could be easily lured into thinking that some super-powerful weapon could end all wars on our planet forever. But they were definitely not the only ones who thought so. They are just as flawed as everybody, and they also pay dearly for their mistakes."

I've rated many, many awesome movies as 9s, but this one surpasses my relatively meager 9 rating. Christopher Nolan's screenplay based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin's American Prometheus is outstanding and does the authors well-deserved justice! Casting is phenomenal. Cillian Murphy (Robert Oppenheimer) knocks it out of the park! Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer) strangles the audience with her relentless drinking! I recently reread American Prometheus in preparation for this movie since I first read it nearly two decades ago. I rediscovered all my underlines from back then that truly spoke to me. They still speak to me now! Because this story takes place across many years, I really appreciate how Nolan switches back and worth with shots in color and then in black/white to separate different times throughout the story. Everyone in this awesome cast plays very well! Cinematography is outstanding. Music is apt. I just knew that 3 hours wasn't going to be too long of a movie, and it was not! I trust Nolan with his storytelling. He can go however long he deems necessary."

",/review/rw9294168/?ref_=tt_urv,When a film gets this much praise you wonder whether it'll fall flat on it's face and it does but only after the bomb.... I had no interest in the Communist sub-plot. It wasn't that interesting and if he loses his security clearance...so what? His character became a bit repetitive as well and the dialog just wasn't interesting enough. It started off so well but he couldn't keep it up. I don't believe Nolan is that skilled/nuanced a director to make such a film work. He should stick to more action based movies because if you delve into his films the scripts and sometimes the acting isn't his forte and for Oppenheimer to work the script is rather childish and immature in the second half. It dragged very badly and I couldn't wait for it to finish. I won't want to watch this one again yet I've re-watched many of his previous films. Shame. PS where were the incredible scenes of the bomb which were being quoted. Didn't see anything amazing there.

",/review/rw9222076/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer isn't a bad movie. It's a good movie. It's just difficult to know just how good it is since the dialogue is constantly interrupted either by over the top sound effects or a self important and intrusive soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson. It isn't that Christopher Nolan thinks he's Michael Bay. There's only one explosion, but it is a big one. It's just that he might as well have been Michael Bay, exchanging explosions on the screen for an explosive soundtrack. I don't know if Ludwig Göransson thinks he's the new Vangelis or the next Hans Zimmer, but he is neither. They must have a great sound system in the studio's mixing room. It's just too bad the average Cineplex can't quite match it."

My companion and I weren't alone in finding this a meandering, wearisome and self indulgent account of Robert Oppenheimer's life and time at Los Alamos, and the aftermath.

4 August 2023,8," Impressive
",/review/rw9237544/?ref_=tt_urv,I saw this in IMAX. Though most of the film consists of people talking and talking and talking...it is never dull and it held my attention for the entire 3 hours. The film is also LOUD. The soundtrack is overpowering and extremely emotionally manipulative. It's as if the composer was asked to illustrate in sound how the audience should feel at every single moment. It made me think of opera...specifically Richard Wagner's theory of the Gesammtkunstwerk where all of the arts work together to provide a super sensory experience beyond any reality. The sound (or music) is meant to communicate with your subconscious as opposed to your conscious mind. But I sometimes became all too conscious of the soundtrack and found it distracting. That's why I rate this film at an eight. Nevertheless this is a must-see film and I thank the filmmakers for giving us something very worth watching.

However, the moment that it actually began I was drawn in and enthralled. I did not even feel how long it was and could honestly say that I would have sat through an extra hour comfortably to have remained in Nolan's vision. It did not even occur to me during the screening to leave to go to the toilet and I only noticed that I desperately needed to go when the end credits began rolling."

The scientists are becoming better known now than perhaps ever before. I know that the art of film-making does not always keep the story perfectly accurate, nevertheless this film seems to be doing a great job getting people interested in learning more about the development of the science that resulted in the atomic bomb as well as many other innovations that came after the war. That would be a very good thing."

It's watchable, the filming is beautiful and filmed in the Nolan style that most people love, it's a good story and the amount of famous actors is insane, clearly they fall over themselves these days to be in a Nolan movie. The film is long and although we'll written with some great performances I felt it lacks any real entertainment and tension with the exception of the test scenes, it feels a very political story. For me Nolan has clearly peaked, Batman, inception and interstellar where up there in most peoples top 5 of all time, Dunkirk, Tenet and now this are nowhere near that standard, it's worth a watch but don't expect an IMBD top 25 movie."

Oh, yeah, the story is set against the backdrop of the development of the A-bomb in the later part of the Second World War. Proving once again that Americans can't be trusted to explore their own cultural history with any real subjectivity. Kitty seemed to be the only character with any backbone and a grip on reality. Frankly the second half is a really boring exploration into the dirty hypocritical backroom politics that the US is famous for. Truth be told, largely a waste of good 70mm film stock."

The storylines, the pilot drama in black and white, the historical creation of the bomb, the Security clearance Hearing and the flashbacks from Oppenheimer's life go hand in hand and support each other well. The movie does a great job of laying the complexity of the ethical debate around the creation of the bomb and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, without taking sides. However don't be surprised if the movie leaves you without the pure area of an Inception, Interstellar, or TeneT. Less questions are left open and more depressing topics are explored. Overall definitely worth the money and time."

The need for a kind of drug? All over the world there are, indeed, entertainment firms and organisations which exploit cinema and television and spectacles of many other kinds. Our starting-point, however, should not be there, but in the essential principles of cinema, which have to do with the human need to master and know the world. I think that what a person normally goes to the cinema for is time: for time lost or spent or not yet had. He goes there for living experience; for cinema, like no art, widens, enhances, and concentrates a person's experience-and not only enhances it but makes it longer, significantly longer."""

With that being said, it's also a picture perfect example on how a movie can be so enthralling with just those two things. #2) I'm predicting some Oscar nominations in the future, specifically from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and RDJ.

The editing made it more difficult to understand than it actually is. Nolan expects us to understand the plot while cutting back to back people talking. Nolan didn't bother with showing the analogy between Arjuna's inaction before war with that of Oppenheimer building a nuke. Nolan completely neglected the importance of Bhagavad Gita even worse is the disrespect. One of the most famous clip of Oppenheimer is where he recites a cryptic line justifying his actions and people would expect to learn more of it but nope. He also didn't the bother with the victims of the bomb. Credit where credit's due, the technical aspects of showing the atomic level visuals is impressive. Overall I would say this movie is a wasted opportunity."

",/review/rw9248620/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie is not for everyone. You need to have some knowledge of history and science to understand certain plot points. Oppenheimer is also very slow-paced, but it does not suffer from it, like other movies. But the people who enjoy these kinds of films are going to love this one. The movie does an amazing job of putting us in the eyes of J. Robert Oppenheimer and exploring the mind of a physicist, filled with inspiration, anxiety and fear. What binds this movie together is the score by Ludwig Göransson. It's like flows with the movie like a river and entangles itself with the story. Another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan that makes us question the world we live in, gives us a true fear of Nuclear Weapons and is a must-watch in the theatre. Highly recommend, the best movie of 2023 so far."

What struck me the most was its profound relevance to the current concerns surrounding artificial intelligence and ChatGPT. The movie left me awestruck, pondering the potential consequences of advancing technology. It paints a vivid picture of a future where humanity might be like two scorpions in a cage if we let conflicts escalate. Thought-provoking and riveting, this film leaves an indelible mark, urging us to reflect on the path our world is taking."

I was not very interested in the making of a bomb as it might have been confusing if I didn't have any prior knowledge of it. I decided to watch it in the end at an AMC theater in IMAX WITH LASER. It blew me away. The acting was incredible, and the soundtrack was also very well done. I thought it would be a long 3 hours, but the movie was over before I even knew it. Time goes by so fast when watching a amazing movie, which is what happened when I was watching Oppenheimer. IT was so good that I watched it AGAIN in IMAX just a couple days after. The bomb scene was very visually appealing, and considering no CGI was used during the bomb scene, it was very amazing to see how you don't always need CGI to create an amazing scene. Robert Downey Jr. Had one of his best performances yet, and Cillian Murphy did not dissapoint, as he brought an amazing performance for J. Robert Oppenehimer. I would highly recommend this movie, as it is an amazing movie and the best movie of 2023."

I really don't know how I'm going to be able to watch any other piece of cinema without comparing it to Oppenheimer. Lately movies haven't been doing it for me lately I feel like the directors are always trying to push something down our throats and feel cheaply made, this movie is different we are truly lucky to be alive during Cristopher Nolans reign. I think he will go down as the best director of all time if he keeps quality of movies up."

One thing that is important in this movie and storytelling is each and everyone in this movie has their important role. From Oppenheimer (Cillian murphy) to Davil Hill (Rami Malek), as chris nolan says there's no small character or big character it's about their importance and relevance. The audience would actually feel the trauma of Oppenheimer after the detonation. Also hoyte van hoytema did his job in more profound way by building actual B&W negative film stock with kodak for shooting in camera rather than decolouring it later and the results were just perfect. Also the depth of IMAX 70/15 is too good specially on closeups. 3D without the glass. One of the best bomb or atomic bomb detonation scene in the history of cinema. Also the trinity score behind it builds the tension and pressure perfectly. I still remember in theatre some people were on the edge of the seat, some were still, some people had there eyes wide open (me too). The silence was the loudest impact of the movie in this scene as the audience were silent so they felt there were actually there on the field. The movie's score has proven that how versatile and good Ludwig Göransson is. You could never feel this if you haven't seen this theatre specially in biggest screen possible. I think it is clearly an new age cinema from Christopher nolan and Hoyte van hoytema."

",/review/rw9237093/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan really screwed up here. He joined the scores of other Hollywood movies where you can understand what the actors are saying only half the time. I didn't think it made any sense to switch between black and white and color. I think the sex scenes were gratuitous and unnecessary. They were more of a distraction. Don't get me wrong, I love watching naked women in movies, but this takes away from the storyline of this nonfiction film. I wish there had been some scenes from World War II in Europe. Yes, this movie was about only Oppenheimer, but to add a few scenes from the major events of the world at the time, the setting would've been better. The time period would've been more apparent. This is where the lack of clear dialogue makes the movie a failure. If you're not gonna show some scenes of Europe at war in WWII during this time, period, at least make the actors enunciate and sound clear."

The bigger the screen the better. Sound, effects, and story are great but like all sound these days, the score tends to overpower the dialogue. Nolan's characteristic nonlinear story telling is ever present. If you hate flashbacks and jumps in time, you have to suck it up. The tension between Oppy and Teller over the ""h-bomb"" is a great sub-plot. Dr Lawrence of ""Lawrence-Livermore"" labs is seen more in this film than in other versions of the Manhattan project. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey will earn nominations for their performances when award season rolls around."

The acting is really good, but those few gems just couldn't hold the attention throughout the movie and make it enjoyable in general. Watching the movie until the end, after the culmination, was excruciating, and the denouement was too pointless and too predictable. Such a long film should basically have a more complex interpretation of the story and a multi-faceted storyline with at least some unexpected twists, because the one that was played did not evoke any emotions."

So many contradictions, so much duplicity and never a dull moment in the 3 hours of watching. The moment of detonation was such a powerful reset on the entire film, theory only gets you so far, now once practice started there was no turning back.

",/review/rw9209540/?ref_=tt_urv,"Huge Nolan fan but felt a bit letdown on this adaptation of storytelling. As expected the edit had you moving to different times frames of the story, but to a fault. Sometimes less is more. It felt too disjointed in the story telling for me. It wasn't taxing to follow along and know where you were at in the overall story arch for most of the movie but it was enough that it really distracted from the story itself. I'd be curious to see the post production edit process and understand the thought process that goes into Nolan's specific style of story telling. The score at times is distracting and takes away from the movie. Less is more. Let the weight of the acting and dialogue along with camera angles and edit push the tension needed. Pumping louder and louder violin and other music and sound does build tension but to me felt overdone and unnatural. It really distracted and took away from the acting which is a shame. The lensing of the film is pure magic and I soaked it all in at a showing in 70mm film. It felt the full 3 hours and had me checking my watch to see how much time was left. I've seen other 3 hour movies and felt disappointed in reaching the end to quickly. It will win awards and I give big kudos on the filming, tackling this story and the acting. I think the film could have used some lighter moments in both expressing joy and humor to balance and tug the audiences around. The nudity scenes didn't add to the story and the one was a bit uncomfortable which is what he was going for in the scene. I most likely won't be rewatching the film but am interested in leaning a bit more about the story."

The BGM highjacks the scenes though it reduce as the time progresses. Oppenheimer is shown as a perfect man with almost everyone as his friend which is not the case even if you read his Wikipedia page. It doesn't even talk about let alone go in depth about his personal mental hardships, how he became a chain-smokers, etc. Which would have been an amazing plot points. Rami Malek can't blende into the character and his presence is same as any of his previous work except for Bohemian Rhapsody. RDJ is phenomenal actor, no one can tell if he is the same actor who played the Iron Man. Coming back to Wikipedia, even it has more Hindu references to Oppenheimer than this movie. The reference in this movie is intentionally insulting. Even if it is a 3 hour long, it doesn't feel very slow."

It should have been shortened to 2 hours. The interrogation scenes were just too stretched out. And the subject of this interrogation was not even that interesting. I understand that Nolan didn't just want to make a movie how Oppenheimer built the bomb but wanted to add something else which allowed flashbacks. But at the end of the movie I was like ""This is it?"". I also didn't understand why sometimes scenes were in color and sometimes in black and white. I'm sure Nolan used this to tell us something but I must have totally missed it. There are a number of Nolan movies that should be watched twice or even three times to understand them better, such as TENET, Inception, Dunkirk. And if you watch these again, you will find parts that you have overlooked and you can enjoy the movie with a different perspective. But I have absolutely no desire to watch Oppenheimer again. It would simply be too boring."

There's a scene where Oppenheimer teaches in a Dutch town called ""Leiden"" I am Dutch myself and found it really nice to once again encounter something Dutch in a big movie, it just awakes some sort of patriotic flame. But the words he said, they weren't Dutch. It was just some mumbling of vaguely sounding German words. That's a missed opportunity imo. It shows that Hollywood doesn't always wants to je accurate and that's quite disappointing, it also doesn't give the character the right credits, Oppenheimer spoke many languages and should've been credited with his multilingualism."

I saw exactly what I expected which was unusual in itself for a Nolan's film. The movie is set at a period when philosophy mattered as much as physics for a scientist. The movie is all about one person who sees the world around him differently. This visionary genius is now under the terrible predicament of finding the most horrible weapon for the greater good which also happens to be his passion, nuclear fission. The same predicament which Krishna put himself under to instigate destruction. Sadly, he is also put on trial for his exact achievement later. So, He has to bare the cross and get crucified for it! Cillian Murphy recreated Oppenheimer like a magician. The tempo of the movie along with its wave-natured background score using it to pump your adrenaline at key moments.

Special effects are a tool to aid a movie not to become the movie. Acting on the other hand was spot on, who'd a thunk Robert Downie jr could play such a mean nasty guy so well. The Ciaran guy was good too. Many know him from Peaky Blinders which I never watched so I wasnt quite so enamoured. Loved Mat Damon and the nasty lawyer going after Oppenheimer was amazing.

Of course, Nolan is the most misogynistic he could ever be having women characters who spout about nothing more than Men. It's just pathetic and in no way do I think these films will hold up. Maybe as a means to see some glimpse of a historical event, but nothing more than that. No heart. No thing to latch on to. No interest whatsoever in Nolan's interests at all.

The intensity of such trials always takes me to the end of my seat, very happy this movie included such scenes. I do feel like the movie, or at least certain dialogues tend to paint some black and white paintings on who is the villain and who the hero, which brings empathy that is ofcourse very nice to feel towards protagonists.

Firstly the biography of the scientist is very well portrayed with factual history. In my opinion there could have been more entertainment factors added to engage the audience more. The movie is 3 hours long in length which does make it seem VERY slow. Half the audience were asleep. The beauty of Nolan is he doesn't make it seem that there are any unnecessary scenes in the movie it feels required. The acting performances are excellent. Main lead by Cillian murphy he has also appeared in Mr. Nolans previous hits in smaller roles but now I feel he got the deserving role. His body language and expressions as oppeheimer are fantastic: Living the character. Following other big names too like R. D. J with a good performance too as an antagonist. Now the best part about the movie is the sparkling cinematography which lead the audience eyes shining. I watched this in Imax 70 MM on the best screen possible so I cant talk about the regular but Im sure it still shows. Its worth taking 70 MM from what I saw. The other good thing was the sound design also exceptional. Makes you feel your in the movie. Everytime there is a bomb the audience gets a jumps care. The whole audience in my theatre didint say a word for the whole movie even though it was a full house no seats available (even though it was a weekday).

Second, the first 30 minutes was difficult to follow as the timeline kept bouncing around (to be fair, I missed the very opening so maybe there was something there that may have helped explain it).

He is the genius white male who wants to save the world by creating the atomic bomb and then cant stand the burden of his own creation. He is turned into a martyr by political circumstances so he gets to be remembered as the genius scientist, yet he keeps none of the responsability of his creation.

As a Director and cinematographer he continually pushes the boundaries in search of perfection and wants his team and the actors to go with him. Sometimes he'll win and sometimes he won't but he doesn't patronise his audience. Yet again this is another of his films where you'll need a second or third viewing to fully enjoy the nuances and interactions that evolve. Murphy leads brilliantly and all the support and ensemble cast are portrayed very well. The script is deep and the meaning that one can take from the experience is multi-layered. The movie has different facets that will appeal from the use of colour and B/W to the powerful score. The sound is amazing in IMAX albeit can overwhelm the narrative (a recent and I'd say valid gripe against Nolan). The story arc is not linear, a classic Nolan feature which I like and the pay-off is haunting. For me this ending is as close as one can get to a movie about pacifism albeit you'd never have felt that for most of the entire film!!!"

Two hearings were going on in the beginning and only much later we are explained what's going on, but by that time I got exhausted just keeping up. Also once the explanation is given I didn't care enough. I usually don't check time or speak with anyone during the movie but it was very hard not to.

23 July 2023,10," Maybe the best film of this decade so far
",/review/rw9208536/?ref_=tt_urv,"There are two words to describe Oppenheimer: cinematic masterpiece. None of the achievements of this film could be done without writer/director Christopher Nolan. The script is absolutely phenomenal. It's a dialogue heavy three-hour film, but the tension and master class writing created by Nolan keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The score by Ludwig Goransson is fantastic, as it also helps build tension in almost every scene. The film jumps before, after, and during the testing of the atomic bomb, but it is surprisingly not too difficult to follow, and it is kept extremely interesting throughout. Another thing to note is the absence of CGI in the film, which is mind-blowing to think about after you've seen it. There are tons of shots showing close ups of the explosion, atoms, neutrons, etc., which you would think Nolan would use CGI for, but he doesn't, and all of these shots are visually stunning. It is just such an amazing accomplishment. Another key factor in this movie is the incredible acting from everyone involved. There are tons of A-list actors sprinkled throughout, some even just having one scene, and they all give great performances. One in particular is Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. Einstein is in a scene at the beginning, middle, and end, but the impact he has on the film is really memorable and impressive. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer just needs to win Best Actor. His performance summed up in one word is haunting. He haunts with his eyes, the way he delivers his lines, and the way he just stares. He really shows the audience how depressed and miserable Oppenheimer was particularly after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Robert Downey Jr also shows how he isn't just Tony Stark, but an incredible actor with a wide range. Everyone involved absolutely deserves an award; the film is that great. Nolan's biopic Oppenheimer proves he is one of the great directors of all time."

Ok he actually looks like Oppenheimer with the hollowed-out cheeks and piercing blue eyes, but this guy can act and he obviously worked damned hard at getting this so right. However, we are blitzed with star performances throughout and Christopher Nolan has an uncanny ability to allow something of the individual actor's personality to inhabit the character they play and that's genius."

",/review/rw9274208/?ref_=tt_urv,"Nolan's nonlinear oscillation of Oppenheimer's story soaks one's mind and soul in itself. It fuses and motions through multiple faucets of oppenheimer's life whilst ensuring our wisdom of science and politics on point. Along with one's capable cerebral ability is required to enhance it deeply. His compelling written story traverses into several themes and is ushered by Nolan's direction to a three-hour long work of mastery. The moment you begin to assimilate this master work, you anticipate a flamed-steamy atomic explosion performed practically will blow your nerves off. The repercussions of this mass destruction are perceived with the dazed mind that one hurdles in the echoes of cries and pain. The breathtaking cinematography & a reverberating background score is an achievement closest to the molecules and sightseeing to world of oppenheimer's biopic, it gushes on the screen like a realization of magnificence of cinema and science. The monochrome segment dilutes with conviction of a great craft and revolves to set an intriguing conclusion. The Impeccable Cillian Murphy brings the character to life and so does every other cast suits up to fit considerably well. The trinity test is a place to set up Oppenheimer's regretful invention. The aftermath of success of triumph puts Oppenheimer on a trail that tries to subdue him and here's comes a time when one must stand firm for oneself. Oppenheimer has been left to live in remorse and guilt of his own creation that horrifies him like a death, and so does he says, ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."""

",/review/rw9206134/?ref_=tt_urv,"Nolan's long awaited Oppenheimer is here , and to put it frankly, it 's a bomb. This is a cash grab, Oscar bait and (maybe) a tentpole rolled into one. Murphy s decent in the title role and some of the cinematography is good, but it will be hard to stay awake through most of it. Long, dull and pointless sequences go on for just too long. When the next sequence comes, you probably will have forgotten the previous one. And on, and on and on it goes for three l-o-n-g hours. About the best aspect that is touched upon is the guilt he feels after his creation is used. Also then time period of the 40s to 50s is presented in a matter of fact, non nostalgic fashion and Blunt is fairly decent as his wife. Kenneth Branagh has some decent scenes impersonating Nils Bohr However,Matt Damon seems ill at ease in his role. Now back to the review. Even though Oppenheimer probably had no idea of the Pandora's box he would be opening, it must be remembered that at least a million or more Japanese and American lives would have been lost if America was to invade Japan. It also touches on his personal life and his run-ins with the State Department when it is revealed his wife is a communist. Now don't get me wrong. I'm a history buff and a movie fan and I have no problem with long historical film biographies like 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Gandhi' and 'Patton'. These were gripping, well made, exceptionally well acted films by master directors. Unfortunately in this era of diminished expectations about the entire movie going experience. Director Nolan is still very wet behind the ears and still has a lot to learn before he can even consider making a film of that magnitude Most likely this film will appear to techno geeks and algebra nerds, but you want a real feature about Oppenheimer, you'll be better off renting good documentary on the subject. Though its not as junk movie like 'The Dial of Destiny', at best it's an interesting misfire and a waste of three hours. Another PU movie review from Lou in a miserable movie summer."

All other actors have done good job. Music is atmospheric and blends well with the scenes, except for a few instances where it gets too loud and annoying.

This film peers into his life, achievements, relationships and flaws with the backdrop of the race to make a functioning atomic bomb first before the Nazis and then before the Soviets. Although this film, on paper, could read much like a biopic, a more accurate genre for this film would be ""thriller"" edging on ""horror"". From the first sequence, the viewer is gripped by the momentum of the film and never given a chance to recover. The editing, acting, sound design and cinematography all work in unison to push the viewer along through this complex narrative and create a truly transfixing experience. Although the initial viewing was an impressive experience, the pace of the narrative and complexity of the cast and dialogue lended to an amount of confusion that was not negligible. Upon second viewing, it was much easier to follow the plot and characters, allowing me to have a different and even more immersive and emotional experience than the first viewing. This may be a problem for some viewers who do not wish to see the movie twice, but as many Nolan fans will understand, his style of movie making challenges the viewer, and this film is no different.

I was as excited as always to see the new stuff from him, but this time I left dissappointed. It felt like if Christoffer Nolan directed twelve angry men, only in three paralell timelines. I get that Oppenheimer had a fascinating and important story, but this was not a particulary good movie.. It was incredibly made production wise. Probably one of few movies with top tier actors, and delivers. But movie wise it's too thin. The bit that bothered me the most was the editing. So fast paced. Jumping from one conversation to the next one. The whole film kinda felt like a blockbuster movie trailer, and when I watch the trailer - that has a much better pace than the movie. Going to watch it again to see if I missed anything, but at the moment this didn't feel like a Nolan movie. I even liked Tenant which many didn't.."

The movie felt like a thriller and had me on the edge of my seat in some scenes. The score was also incredible and presented so many emotions that's created moods and tension throughout the film.

However, there was scenes that got me fired up. The boring red scary McCarthyism garbage causing him of being a spy, his wife being a cuckquean watching imagining her husband do. Girl on a chair who had nothing almost to do with the plot. It was so boring after the bomb went off. I nearly fell asleep hoping something interesting would happen. I wasn't expecting action or anything like that but I didn't expect it to end where he gets his clearance revoked?! Ok? They found him to be a loyal citizen yet revoked it because he was doing what Matt Damon asked him to do?? And I'd like talk about one scene too that got me fired up. This is during world war 2 so while there's millions of men dying out Europe and the east, there's a general and men in suits who are just sitting and talking about bombing Japan and one man goes ""we have 12 cities to bomb. Well 11 actually, me and my wife went on vacation to this city before"" this scene made me mad. And then all of oppenheimers colleagues turned against him. And iron man (RDJ) was playing the big bad politician or something. And jack quaid is there. Mostly a boring movie. I give it a 4/10 because I give where respect is due watching that bomb was pretty cool in imax. I shouted out ""wow."" Once it ignited in silence. But other than that this is just American anti communist propaganda bs who ruined the reputation of a great physicist who was just doing what the government asked him to do but think only him could have created it he even said it was a matter of time until they discover how to make these hydrogen bombs.

Christopher Nolan has once again created a masterpiece in terms of production quality, cinematography, sound, and of course...the writing. Oppenheimers story is powerful and very complex as he works in the second World War to build a bomb that will hopefully end the war, but as all things do, problems arise for our protagonists. One of the things this film did exceptionally well, was portray Oppenheimer as he was, no bars held. As you may have guessed, he is not a good person, and the film did not stray away from revealing that. It showed he had good intentions but in the end wasn't the best. The sound design team deserves an Oscar themselves for how outstanding they did. The theater shook and rumbled all around us as the classic marching sound swelled and filled the theater, and the sounds the bomb made and his visions made were so good. The movie also successfully filled all 3 hours worth with story, and kept me immersed the entire time. As for the cons, which is only one, the movie is truly and mostly just men talking in a room for 3 hours. Overall, if you want a deep, powerful movie with excellent acting and production design, you should absolutely check this film out."

As Scorsese said superhero movies are not cinema and I agree and if you want to know what is cinema then watch this masterpiece. It is Nolan's most subtle and poingnant work may be his best I don't know. The film doesn't rely on heavy breathing spectacle like Nolan's previous works,it is pure drama and everyone must watch it in the biggest possible screen.

This film had a nonlinear story line and showed this through the switch black and white, and colour film clearly showing the viewer the distinction between the past, present and near future.

Nolan actually did a great job since this is a 3 Hours long movie about Father of the atomic bomb. I really like the transition between Oppenheimer POV and the Strauss one.

Apparantly I don't look a day over 15, thanks I guess?? Personally, the film is a little too long, with the most notable part of the film happening over the half-way mark. And the relationship between Robert (Murphy) and Jean (Pugh) confused me a little, don't know why because it was pretty self-explanatory. It's just the way that she decides to end her life because he said they couldn't see eachother anymore... After all the times that she gave hints that she was only in it for the 'fun'...Hmmm. What I do like about the film, and I mean I REALLY like it, was the lead-up to the testing of the bomb. The tension that was created just in the scenes of the creation and when they were hoisting it up. Plus, the weather. The weather should have been paid for it's job because WOW. But, when the testing scene came, I literally stopped breathing. I don't know how to describe how beautifully made that scene was. Nolan is in my good books for this film."

",/review/rw9235643/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie is not all boring, it has some amazing moments. But it does not feel like a movie rather than a over explanatory trailer about a great movie. It constantly feels like it's moving either to fast or to slow. Sometimes you feel like you are just being force feed information at a rate that no human ever would find pleasing. Other times you almost fall asleep beacuse of the low tempo. The movie also focuses more on the political side of the manhattan project rather than oppenheimer himself. Therefore when any emotional scenes with oppenheimer and his close ones would appear you would just feel like the third wheel of a relationship that you barely knew existed. I personally feel this is the problem with alot Cristhofer Nolan's movies. I do love some of his work, but constantly i feel like i never really knew the characters that well. With Memento as a exception. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer did well enough. In the start of the movie he was very interesting and displayed alot of emotions through his acting. By the half and the end it more felt like i was watching some sigma male tiktok compilation. This really made the movie alot harder to watch than it should have been. The only emotions displayed by Cillian at the end was intensly staring in to the distance, so the marketing team was perhaps not lying. This was made even more clear when seeing Gary Oldman as Truman. In my opinion he outpreformed every single one with his scene. His face shifted so slightly with each new emotion and really had you at the edge of your seat. Cillian's intensive stare quickly became exposed of its shortcomings by this preformance. I could go into the visual side of this movie but we all know they are the best as always with Cristhofer Nolan so im not gonna waste your time with that. I am going to say that Ludwig Göransson made an absolute banger with the score to this movie and it truly made the whole experience alot better."

While you can probably enjoy the movie without knowing much history of the subject, it's very rewarding if you learn some background on the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, Oppenheimer, and Strauss as there isn't much handholding done by Nolan."

",/review/rw9272774/?ref_=tt_urv,"From a scientific point of view, Oppenheimer lacks certain aspects and explanations but given the fact that the movie is not a sci-fi movie ( it's more biographical and historical movie), we could ignore that. I'd also want to point that Oppenheimer has contributed a lot to his domain of study but he was not surely as same level as Niels Böhr, Albert Einstein, Max Born or even Richard Feynman as the movie strived extremely to do in that direction. That side aside, from a cinematic, cinematographic and screen-writing point of view, it's a coherent and well structured movie. The beginning is colossal and symbolic. The moral challenges of Oppenheimer are very well represented and I admire the fact that he's portrayed as a complicated character as most of us are in our routine life but we don't comprehend it that well. The transition between colors and WB is a wise choice from a directorial and cinematic point. This movie has a coherent story and creates a certain amount of suspense, even though most of us already knew how it would end for Oppenheimer and obviously the other people involved. If you are really a cinephile and history lover, that would be a great chance to watch this movie. I believe genuinely that this is Nolan's best work. It doesn't have the complexity as it was the theme of Nolan's movies narratives and that let the audience to perceive the movie in a more simpler, yet smarter way. It is also one of the most aesthetic movies of his filmography and current-era cinema."

31 July 2023,7," Oppenheimer
",/review/rw9228388/?ref_=tt_urv,"Along with Barbie, this was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, both films were released the same day, they are complete polar opposites, and the phenomenon spawned a social media trend called ""Barbenheimer"", to see both films as a double feature. I did not personally do this craze, I booked both films on the same day but saw them separately, I looked forward to this film with its darker subject matter, written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, The Dark Knight, Dunkirk, Tenet). Basically (in linear order), in 1926, twenty-two-year-old (Julius) J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is studying at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, under Patrick Blackett (James D'Arcy), but he suffers from homesickness and anxiety. After Blackett forces him to miss part of a lecture, Oppenheimer injects an apple left for him with cyanide. The next day, he has a change of heart and narrowly prevents visiting scientist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) from eating it. Oppenheimer completes his PhD in physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he meets Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer). Returning to the United States, Oppenheimer hopes to expand quantum physics research, and begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He meets and is infatuated with biologist and ex-communist Katherine ""Kitty"" Puening (Emily Blunt), his future wife. He also has a sporadic affair with Communist Party USA member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), but she had severe clinical depression and committed suicide, submerging her head in a partly filled bathtub. In 1942, during World War II, U. S. Army General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb after he assures the general that he has no sympathy with the communists. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis, under Heisenberg's supervision, possibly trying to complete their nuclear weapons program. Oppenheimer assembles a scientific team including Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) and Isidor Isaac Rabi (David Krumholtz) in Los Alamos, New Mexico. There, a town is built in the middle of the desert, and the workers are encouraged to bring their wives who will work on site while the bomb is secretly created. He coordinates with other sites, including the Met Lab in Chicago, where he meets with nuclear physicists Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari) and David L. Hill (Rami Malek). He also visits Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) to discuss how an atomic bomb could trigger an unstoppable chain reaction that could destroy the world. When Germany surrenders and the war is approaching its end, there is doubt from some of the scientists of the project's importance, but Oppenheimer assures them that the bomb could be used to end the war with Japan. The atomic bomb is completed, and the countdown begins as the Trinity test, which takes place just before the Potsdam Conference on 16 July 1945. The detonation of the prototype device in the desert is a complete success. President Harry S. Truman (Gary Oldman) orders atomic bombs to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan to surrender. Oppenheimer is thrust into the public eye, including on the cover of Time magazine, as the ""father of the atomic bomb."" But Oppenheimer feels personal responsible and is haunted by the destruction and suffering. Oppenheimer meets Truman and urges him to close Los Alamos and not develop even more powerful weapons. Truman perceives Oppenheimer's distress as weakness and insists that, as President, he is responsible for the use of the bomb. Oppenheimer advocates against further nuclear development, especially the hydrogen bomb proposed by Teller. His stance creates disagreements in the middle of the tension building in Soviet Union that is leading up to the Cold War. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), chairman of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing his concerns regarding the export of radioisotopes and for recommending arms talks after the Soviets detonate their first atomic bomb. He also believes Oppenheimer, when meeting Einstein, criticised him. Oppenheimer is called to a hearing where he is betrayed by Teller and other associates intending to remove him from political influence. Strauss exploits Oppenheimer associating with current and former communists such as Tatlock and his own brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold). Despite Rabi and several other allies defending Oppenheimer in their testimonies, Oppenheimer's security clearance is prematurely revoked. Oppenheimer's public image is damaged, and his policy influence is neutralised. Five years later, at Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies that Strauss has personal motives when engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. The Senate votes against Strauss's nomination. An enraged Strauss meets Oppenheimer in private, ranting against him being a hypocrite, saying if had the chance he would do it again because it made him important. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson (Hap Lawrence) presents Oppenheimer the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. Oppenheimer and Einstein's conversation is revealed to have not been about Strauss, but the far-reaching implications of nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer ominously states that he believes his actions have indeed started a chain reaction that will destroy the world. Also starring Casey Affleck as Boris Pash, A Cure for Wellness's Dane DeHaan as Major General Kenneth Nichols, Jason Clarke as Roger Robb, Alden Ehrenreich as Senate Aide, Gustaf Skarsgård (Stellan's son) as Hans Bethe, Michael Angarano as Robert Serber, Jack Quaid as Richard Feynman, Josh Peck as Kenneth Bainbridge, Olivia Thirlby as Lilli Hornig, Matthew Modine as Vannevar Bush, Tony Goldwyn as Gordon Gray, Alex Wolff as Luis Walter Alvarez, Emma Dumont as Jackie Oppenheimer, Scott Grimes as Counsel, and James Remar as Secretary of War Henry Stimson. Murphy is perfectly cast as the title character, and he is supported by a terrific all-star cast, including Blunt as his supportive wife, Damon as the general, Downey Jr. As the businessman, Pugh as the sultry mistress, Branagh as a teacher, and Oldman as the President of the United States. Nolan is no stranger to big scale blockbusters and does a fine job telling the true story of the scientist who developed the atom bomb. The non-linear storytelling, scientific jargon and political stuff, and the three-hour running time test your patience, and I'm not sure what the point of the bits in black-and-white were, but for the tense first bomb test scene, its fantastic editing, visuals, and sound design (the delayed explosion genuinely startled me) is the highlight. It is very long and very chatty, but Murphy and the ensemble cast are all great, it is ambitious, dramatic, stylish, and historically interesting, a worthwhile biographical thriller. Very good!"

When seeing this movie's premise, you'd think maybe it just end with the explosions and it's done, but it goes for another hour after that. You really get to see everything, and feel bad for Oppenheimer at the end.

Being based on the book ""American Prometheus,"" we get the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer who was brought on by Lewis Strauss to helm the Manhattan Project that led to the creation of the atomic bomb but Nolan's focus was on the mam himself and not the bomb which proves to be brilliant as we get a deep and haunting character study of the aftermath and see how this action led to not only thousands of deaths in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but the guilt and weight that the ""man who moved the earth"" was forced to live with. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer proves to be the best casting choice made for this biopic as his eyes in close-ups tell you everything you need to know about what he's thinking, but in addition this brilliant actor conveys so much conviction and deep regret for all of his skeletons that you're left with a broken man who started off doing something monumental with ambitious intentions but slowly realizes what he's just actually done to the rest of the world, but Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss has my lock already for Best Supporting Actor with what could be his best career work as a man who proves to be more than an antagonist in this film."

Like Jonathan Glazer's upcoming The Zone of Interest, this is a film in which the horrors of war are not shown but conveyed inescapably through what we hear. Ludwig Göransson's score is masterful and mercurial, surely one of the finest of the year. And there's a recurring motif in the soundscape, a crescendo of thunderously stamping feet.

And the performance is perfect for sure we've got a bunch of great actors so no doubt about the acting. Now talk about the plot. This film portrays an atomic bomb that destroys Nagasaki and Hiroshima, we all know about the story of it and how terrifying and dreadful it is then Nolan decided to present things that most people didn't know or were interested in, he decided to portray the insight of the inside story about a man who creates a nuclear bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. And it is outcome intellectual. My favorite scene wouldn't be any scene but the bomb testing scene, it's so spectacular and made my jaw drop. However, I think this film isn't so complex compares to other Nolan films but that's not my complaint at all.

",/review/rw9212490/?ref_=tt_urv,"Ok so i just watched the movie and it was like i expected: a movie about Oppenheimer and his work arround the bombs, his relationship(loves, friends). I definitely learnt more trough the movie. I saw Tenet and there was a reference to Oppenheimer in the movie pretty briefly. And there we are. So the main question in my opinion is: what liberty they took? For dramatic or plot purposes? Or they tried to get as close as the events of that man that we knew. I dont really know. I still was impressed by the visuals, the sound design and the editing. For the dramatic moments (Trinity, the revelation about who really is Teller, the interrogation by the autorities.), the sexual moments (i enjoyed that scene that where he admit that he had an affair with Jean and we had that sexual scene in the middle of the interview where we saw also the wife of Oppenheimer who realised that she get cheated on, mostly also the scenes with Jean -a wonderful body that she has.).the sound design really make the tension escalate more and let us speechless during the bomb test. Im not gonna lie; i found also some moments more intellectual, a little bit too much characters and sometimes it was more boring because of the pace (the details, the slow rythm, the physicians theories and conspiracy )that i had some problems to remembered but except that it was a kind of nice visual experience with a big deep dive into Oppenheimer's life who was pretty dramatic and let us pretty aware of the repercussions of his works for the good reasons and the bad ones. I need also to mention the performances of Cillian Murphy (it was not easy to represent such a man), Matt Damon (its been a long time that i didnt see him in the movies except for the Jason Bourne movies), Florence Pugh (for the sensuality that she brings). Rami Malek that i clearly didnt expect to see. And of Course Robert Downey JR who has a complex character with his words and his status (ally or ennemy?). I need to say that i usually like to see Emily Blunt on screen but here she was really forgettable maybe because she represented just the woman of Oppenheimer and didnt really see an interesting performance from her here but you know she did the job and let us know more trough her who was Oppenheimer at least how they decided to represent him in the movie."

Thanks to a stellar performance from Cillian Murphy, an excellent supporting cast, truly spectacular visuals and an amazing screenplay, this is probably the best film of 2023 if not one of the best films period (truly surprising considering that Spiderverse came out beforehand). Regardless of historical accuracy, despite politics this film will force you to think and glue you to your seat (if you have the attention span for it). All in three hours the story of Robert Oppenheimer's life and work on the creation of the atomic bomb correlate with the events that transpired it masterfully. As with every Nolan film the plot is continuous and fast-pased, but manages to encapsulate all of the significant moments of Oppenheimer's life in a way that presents it as one of achievement and horror. The visual spectacle and the amazing score alone project the true terror and beauty of mankind's biggest threat. This is not just a film about the life of one man and the troubling events that occurred in his lifetime, it is a philosophical exploration of the truly terrifying realization that mankind is it's own worst enemy. I can without a doubt say that this film is one of Nolan's best and will remain as perhaps one of the greatest biopics ever made."

It's not going to be his most watchable being that it's 3 hours of drama. This will require multiple viewings to get everything. On the technical side Nolan creates some of the most visual spectacles I've witnessed and he's absolutely going to win an Oscar for sound. Everyone including Florence Pugh and Matt Damon were incredible but Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are going to go heavy on awards night. Also this may very well be Christopher Nolans win. There's some pacing issues as I felt like it at times did feel like 3 hours but there's times where it flew by. This movie is an absolute blast (pun intended)."

Contrary to what one might expect from a Nolan film, the exploration of quantum physics is relatively accessible, making the movie enjoyable for a broader audience. In this review, I will try to highlight the significant aspects of the film while avoiding spoilers."

Although Oppenheimer is much deviated from typical Nolan's style of huge scientific theories & insane plot twists, the movie had it's Nolan vibe in the screenplay, cast, background score as well as the buildup."
28 July 2023,8," The Movie Constructed Like a Nuclear Bomb
",/review/rw9221148/?ref_=tt_urv,"It should be known that Oppenheimer is, in many ways, a massive departure from previous Christoper Nolan films, and even includes nude scenes which have gained some media controversy. (On that note, there is an absolutely bizarre sex scene in a board room.) While many Nolan films always have a profound contemplative tone that is coupled with gunshots, constant explosions and doomsday clocks, Oppenheimer most definitely appeals to a different audience that is more ruminative, introverted, and startled by loud bangs. If you are expecting a cathartic roller coaster ride, you should not be paying for admission (or an IMAX ticket for that matter). It will be a waste of your time and you can immediately reduce my rating to five stars or lower. But if you are the ruminative introverted type that loves a profound drama great enough to send you into contemplation for a time, the film will give you what you're looking for."

",/review/rw9203791/?ref_=tt_urv,"Don't get me wrong, the main actor did an outstanding effort, but I felt like the physics visions represented in particles were cheesy, the moment with Jean where he was quoting Bhagavad Gita, when in real life he was quoting it in an interview where he clearly had PTSD was tasteless to be portrayed in a sex scene, the portrayal of his wife as an empowered strong woman when in real life she had severe alcoholism and even broke bones and had car accidents due to her alcoholism was inaccurate, the scene showing him and his affair partner sleeping together in the interrogation room as she was staring his wife into the eyes, when his wife was quite detached from the whole affair ordeal, also unnecessary."

",/review/rw9208996/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer. It's hard for me to describe what I have just seen! Christopher Nolan made the impossible possible. He gave us a unique biography movie with great plot. When it comes to acting, Cillian Murphy gave us the best performance in 2023 so far. His eyes and how they reacted is something extraordinary. Robert downey Jr was magnificent , and all the supporting actors were. Spectacular. What I mostly liked about the movie is that it showed us how human are brutal and dont give a heck about others. The sound mixing was nice even though I miss Hans' Zimmer creativity. Finally Oppenheimer is the best movie in 2023 but not the number movie in Christopher Nolan list."

",/review/rw9225503/?ref_=tt_urv,"I thought the acting in this film was exceptional, to a person. I also didn't think it was too long, and it covered everything that seemed important. My only gripe is the fact that the musical score dominated the film and felt manipulative. In that I mean that there was enough tension and excitement without hearing a thousand violins ramping up the tension. It often was simply too loud. And it made it harder to really hear the dialogue. The scenes I found most satisfying were those where the music was muted and the dialogue came through."

",/review/rw9259296/?ref_=tt_urv,"As a fan of Nolan, this is a biased review. Personally, it is not my favourite Nolan film, but one where, as Director, Nolan trusted his cast and loosened the reigns on control Outstanding performances all around, from the brief Casey Affleck appearance to the outstanding Alden Ehrenreich. Robert Downey Jr underlines why he is a master in this craft, it was a relief to see him shed the MCU costume majestically in this soft spoken yet resentful and powerful character. Even Josh Hartnett provides a powerful performance. I am appreciating this movie more and more as time passes from the viewing. I reckon due to the fact that I was expecting lots of special effects and a very controlled environment. And the more I think about it, the more I realise how Nolan focused on the talent and their performances retelling this important and relevant story. Florence Pugh shines more than she does in a leading role, what a performance, bold, strong. Emily Blunt gives Kitty so much force and presence. Their relationship is a clash of force and subtlety that provide balance reflected on screen."

Then I watched it in IMAX, and I gotta say its definetly worth a watch both in IMAX and regular 2d. The movie is 3 hours long, but I felt like the story never stuck at one point and it was just brilliant. The acting is definetly on another level. Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer is just perfect. The soundtrack is definetly one of the best in the history of cinema. The Sound FX and the VFX is the best I ever saw and heard.. Christopher Nolan is amazing! This movie is definetly worth a watch."

",/review/rw9285408/?ref_=tt_urv,"Just for the shake of clarity and context, this is my first time watching a movie in IMAX. Oh boy was it worth it. Christopher Nolan's ability to extract every piece of acting excellency from his actors shined once more. Cillian Murphy gave his absolutely best performance yet, and Emily Blunt quite literally stole the third act, at least until the final scenes with RDJ. Technically wise, the sound department deserves every oscar it can get, from original soundtrack to mixing and editing. These people should be put besides the word ""Extraordinary"" in the dictionary. The cinematography was what I expected - dark, blue centered with lots of variety - given the fact that it's a Nolan film after all. I don't really remember any other time when I left the movie theatre and couldn't speak for like 10 minutes. I really couldn't explain what I've seen. Although a Tarantino fan for years, Nolan made me jump ship after this incredible masterpiece. It won't really surprise me if Oppenheimer gets 10-11 Oscars. It really deserves it. I really hope this is the time for Nolan to finally get his long awaited oscar as well."

",/review/rw9229713/?ref_=tt_urv,"The most important film ever made. After each viewing - by now I have the third behind me - this opinion solidifies. The exceptional director Christopher Nolan once again succeeds in projecting onto the big screen, with incredible attention to detail, unprecedented narrative structure and groundbreaking audiovisual design, the themes that have accompanied mankind since time immemorial and that make us ourselves a projection screen: Betrayal, death, time, love, the thirst for knowledge and progress. If Christopher Nolan has always based his previous works on these themes latently and sometimes individually, in Oppenheimer he unfolds them in a bundled and cumulative manner, questioning them anew throughout the film and thereby constructing them anew. Oppenheimer is a film that revitalizes, even reanimates, the institution of cinema, which was believed to be dead. The scenes in which the atomic bomb is tested and its dropping on Hiroshima is ""glorified"" in a speech by Oppenheimer are among the best that cinematic art has ever produced. The final section leaves one stunned, thoughtful, and at times disturbed. And that is exactly the task and the unique selling point of a movie theater. A mixture of biopic, horror film, courtroom drama and thriller - tightly packed and intricately knotted as only a Christopher Nolan is capable of. Oppenheimer is a film that society needed. After countless superhero and other CGI-drenched films in recent years, Nolan's 'Opus Magnum' is both an aesthetic delight and an existential challenge for our gray brain cells. That's exactly where the important questions burn themselves in after the viewing: Why is man trying to extinguish himself? What is progress worth at the expense of human lives? And how the hell did the British director manage to translate such a brute production into picture and sound?"

",/review/rw9321199/?ref_=tt_urv,"I work as an professional editor so from my point of view it was a terrible long movie but funny enough it still was almost too short to tell the full story.. They should and could easily have made it into a series with 5-6 episodes instead of trying to forcefully edit a crazy amount of dialogues from one scene to another - and with no breaks and pauses between the scenes for most parts. We only get the pause to digest the huge amount of fast pace-dialogues when the bomb is about to blow up.. I suspect that the movie was originally longer, and that they were ordered to trim it down to meet the cinematic requirements.. - Or maybe Nolan just lost his touch? Tenet was a complete disaster and know this? Someone working close to him needs to ""check him"" and tell him to maybe take a step backwards and keep it more simple.. More is not always better."

The film is beautifully shot and highlights a lot of issues from American politics during the war time, together with some questionable choices that were made, in the name of putting an end to World War II. The director managed to portray really well the moral dilemma that a lot of scientists that worked on the H Bomb felt, realizing that they basically created a mass destruction weapon. There are never particularly gruesome images, but the editing together with the soundtrack, really highlights the terrible consequences that this invention caused. This movie has an incredible sound design, and there are some sequences that are just breathtaking. Nolan always delivered technically competent movies and he is unique in his genre: the practical effects on this one are absolutely jaw dropping."

The person across the aisle checking the time didn't make it shorter. And it doesn't really focus on dropping the bombs, but on robert oppenheimer's dilemma with what he had wrought. Because his ideas were not popular in the early 50's, a very scary time in the usa, they did all they could do to shut him up and discredit him. As for the actors, hats off to robert downey, jr.

But for me a citizen of Eastern Europe it also has an essence of understanding of the great danger that the atomic bomb is. The movie uses no CGI and show real explositions of bombs and it is better than what any CGI could make. It is also very philosophical in its thinking about the threat that the bombs make.

Every scene wants to have you surprised, and honestly, it felt ridiculous after a while. Disappointing storyline. It rather failed to depict Oppenheimer as a real person and scientist. Nolan pictured him as an absolute hero. The conversation around quantum physics and nuclear physics in the movie was a bit shallow and short. There are a lot of great movies and series based on the work of real scientists, such as A beautiful mind, Chernobyl, or Imitation Game which explain their research and achievements with a simplified language for the audience and build the movie around that. The movie was very nationalistic and patriarchal. Just because he's American, there is a notion in the movie that he was the best in his field then. At the time that Einstein, Planck, Schrödinger, and Heisenberg were alive. And the most frustrating part was the representation of women. Drunk, mentally unstable, and angry at all times. It became a pattern in Nolan's movies, I think. All his main characters are men surrounded by dozens of more men. Usually, put one or two women at most in them."

With all the controversy, complexity, and mystery that surrounds this story, be it politics, ethics, or science, this film artfully layered it's scenes with a deep understanding, using metaphors and parallels that left me reeling with contemplation. There are so many layers, that this film can be a completely different movie depending upon how much of this story you knew before, yet still leave you dumbfounded by how beautifully these messages are delivered.

Also nice sound and visual effects clear and crisp you felt as if your were in the film you felt involved lots of great knowledge especially if your a history nerd or just love a good 3 hour film this one is the one for you so this film is recommended it's a 10 out of 10 for me. Enjoy it with friends or family or even alone it quiet a film good job Christopher Nolan you definitely did well.
21 July 2023,10," Awesome RDJ performance as Vindictive Admiral Strauss
",/review/rw9204289/?ref_=tt_urv,"Wow where should I even start the movie began with depressing , wicked young J Robert Oppenheimer in college days in Europe, the way Nolan has captured cillian Murphy in mind boggling way at sometimes he seems careless to the consequences to his invention and sometimes the way he was so distraught with the consequences of his invention is very inventively captured the moral dilemma , geo political evolution , self discovery of Oppenheimer is not only very well portrayed by Cillian Murphy but was greatly captured by Nolan , from the very beginning the vision of atom particular that Oppenheimer sees is captured elegantly but one that got me by surprise was RDJ's Lewis Strauss or Admiral Strauss the way he was so poise , elegant almost throughout the movie then until he was not I won't reveal much but I will say his character is best describe by the Line used in movie by brilliantly played kitty wife of Oppenheimer played by Emily Blunt "" The most vindictive are the one's who has more patience"" so in last I will end this by saying that this is Christopher Nolan at his best all the actor's , crew has done fabulous job this is the movie to watch of the year."
23 July 2023,10," The simplest complexity
",/review/rw9209291/?ref_=tt_urv,Only Nolan can do this mix. When you talk about the atomic bomb and explain the complex physics of it's manufacturing in a such a simple way you have to be Christopher Nolan. But actually the movie is not about the bomb it's about the era of the world war and specifically the scientists and the conflict they suffered when one of the most revolutionary inventions turns into a lethal weapon that will kill hundreds of thousands or more. With the outstanding performance of cillian murphy as usual and the magnificent cast in every single role. The most surprising was Robert Downey Jr he was on fire the best role in his entire career so far. To sum up it's the perfect movie with the perfect director with the perfect cast with perfect soundtrack.

",/review/rw9207495/?ref_=tt_urv,"The incredible layering of the film, complimented by the awesome A lister cast- straight veterans in the field to newcomers with jaw dropping talent, this movie has it all. I think Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is a strong contender for the 2024 Oscars, while Downy Jr's Lewis Strauss deserves an equally well revered nod."
26 July 2023,9," Amazing film
",/review/rw9215781/?ref_=tt_urv,"If you're looking for major explosions and an action packed film, this is NOT it. This is practical effects, amazing dialogue and good view on Oppenheimer and his life and the history of the atom bomb and the moral quagmire on the impact on humanity because of it. Thought provoking and the realization that you can be the smartest man In the room but you have people who want to discredit that. Only reason for not giving it at 10/10 is because the run time. You can feel it towards the end. The run time is worth it however to make sure that you get the entirety of Oppenheimer's life from the start and post WW2."
22 July 2023,10," Takes time to process.
",/review/rw9207633/?ref_=tt_urv,"Even though the film is 3 hours, it seems relatively quick. People who are not very understanding of the political situation over the entire world during the II world war and the importance of what made physicists like Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg etc important are very likely going to find the movie hard to understand. But if you don't come in the category just like me, prepare to have your mind blown. (Pun intended) It's the best ensemble of actors chosen with very conscious casting by Nolan. The ""Can you hear the music"" score is going to give you chills for sure. Everyone were amazing but Cillian, Downey, Damon and Blunt stole the show."

Nolan movies lately become disappointing with make no sense loud soundtracks, literally in the middle of the scene who every one talking and these soundtracks keep going for no reason , the first hour it's really good but more than half the movie just waiting for the bomb to drop and end the movie, every think going fast even with 3 hrs movie , u don't feel any felling for the characters because everything fast , I think Nolan should not use the same style in every movies and back to the old style like prestige and momento which more normal and fell more for the characters than his late movies like dunkirk and tenet , I gave the movie 6 because the beautiful shot and directing."

It is a boring thing for a beer. Something fun, visual and audio, right on the screen. It is one of the most important events of the well, and it is the making of the atomic bomb that changed the future of mankind. I advise anyone to see the movie in the cinema, you will regret it if you miss it...

Dialogue, cinematography and pacing are all on point. Ludwig's score is a perfect match for the aesthetic of the film. I have no doubt that Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt and ESPECIALLY Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy will all be up for awards, alongside Nolan and the movie itself. A future classic to be sure. As far as historical biopics go, a difficult and perhaps sensitive topic to tackle given its relevance today, but the messages and philosophy's shown through how the narrative is written and how history is represented throughout the movie is something I'm sure people will remember. 9/10."

The humanity Cillian Murphy and cast-mates bring to these characters is very rarely seen in film today. It was like you're there with these people taking part in everything that is happening on screen. From the hearings, the classrooms, the labs, and all the way to the Trinity Test itself, it feels like you're there. When that bomb drops, you feel the instant regret and fear that it brought to Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists. This film has a lot of clear love and respect put into it. The practical effects feel more real than ever before and the tension never stops. Not even for a second. You will not leave this film feeling the same as you did when you first sit down. That's a promise."

",/review/rw9255299/?ref_=tt_urv,"Yes there were some good scenes, especially the test in the desert. The rest is a bit confusing and rough, but I got it, it's Nolan's style. I can feel that this movie was shot in 57days. I would have preferred Ron Howard or Oliver Stone as director. Nolan's movie is for sure 1hour too long. The last hour is not necessary. Since Interstellar I start really doubting Nolan's skill. He is for sure light years behind a real genius Stanley Kubrick. He should not even try."

The camera work, the stills all beautiful. Didn't have the luck of seeing it in IMAX because none of the cinemas in my town support it so that was disappointing for myself. Really have to pay careful attention to what is going on, the pacing was constant but tells a great story. The reference to JFK at the end I really appreciated after watching Kevin Costners masterpiece recently. Nolan said that he took inspiration from that film and Lawrence of Arabia, heroine turned to villain and victimised summed up Oppenheimer just like those films. Definitely got my moneys worth today.

The movie's captivating storyline took hold of my senses, whisking me away to a world of magic and intrigue. From the very beginning, I was hooked, unable to tear my eyes away from the screen. The plot unfolded like an intricately woven tapestry, revealing unexpected twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. Nolan's masterful cinematography added another layer of enchantment to the already mesmerizing tale, effortlessly bringing the characters to life. Each frame was a work of art, filled with breathtaking visuals that left me in awe. As the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the unique experience I had just witnessed, one that would undoubtedly stay with me as a cherished memory."

",/review/rw9202086/?ref_=tt_urv,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."

It was would be like if Kanye West's ""Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" album was a movie. Cillian Murphy puts on a virtuoso performance encapsulating the deeply complicated and contradictory life that Oppenheimer lived. The pace that the movie runs at is so intense and the music is used perfectly to capture that. The explosion of the bomb is so realistically filmed that you feel fully immersed in Los Alamos. The subtle themes of ""The Fission"" and ""The""fusion"" floated at the beginning of the movie is an incredible way to depict to the two separate courtroom like battles Oppenheimer and Strauss are involved in.

A judicious recalibration of the storytelling, discerningly excising extraneous segments, could have undoubtedly remedied the pacing predicament, allowing for a more enthralling cinematic experience.

But I do remember the aftermath of much of the happenings here; a long passed away friend who was in the Navy during WWII made a remark during a club meeting where Memorial Day, the 4th of July or another patriotic date was current. He stated that it was clear had we not dropped the bomb, that the carnage in Japan would have been unspeakably abhorrent. It would have been door to door, and person to person. Also Japan dropped Pearl Harbor on us at a time when our entry was not at all inevitable. What struck me what how so little has changed in (in)human nature, especially in politics in general and DC in particular. As an aside, I noticed that ""James Woods"" was an executive producer; there happens to be another James Woods with IMDB and I was pleased that IMDB shows it was the same James Woods whose roles I have enjoyed for so long. I know that as of January 2, 2023, he has not been hired for an acting job since a voice gig since a voice acting job in 2019 due to his outspoken conservative views. Kudos to him.

The characterless blasé, second rate to Zimmer score plays at events so eventless as a man getting out of his car or going to the toilet, drowning out unintelligible lines from actors who focused too much on sounding American as opposed to coherent.

",/review/rw9205342/?ref_=tt_urv,"I think this is second or third best movie from Nolan. The non linearity in storytelling is the typical Nolan thing. If you are Nolan fan ,this movie will keep up the hype. And the acting has been exceptional. Cillian really nailed it and so rdj too. The visuals and background score makes it quite good. If you compare it with other Nolan movies you might find this weak but in this genre you can;t do much .Emily Blunt have some strong scenes. Second half is too paced and good. First half is good and slow but you might not get some stuffs if you miss those conversations in first half. I would have given 9.5 but since i m Nolan fan so i am bit biased here."

It's a nostalgic throwback to the time when Hollywood used to create such thought-provoking movies. This might even be the last of its kind, or perhaps studios will learn from the underwhelming summer movie slate and start taking more risks instead of sticking to formulaic focus-group-approved films."

Don't go and see this movie if you are expecting explosions, this movie is about the politics surrounding the Manhattan project and what followed after the bomb was dropped on Japan.

No one is truly good but just as in all businesses especially government, people can make you just as much as they can also break you.

",/review/rw9235708/?ref_=tt_urv,This could have been an excellent movie with a star studded cast and stand out performance by Killian Murphey. However on a film largely dependent upon dialogue I can't understand why the editors felt it necessary to have constant background music (it never stops throughout the movie) which was discordant and painful to endure. At times it was so loud that hearing what was being said was impossible and even at it quietest it made comprehension difficult.

No. The over arty editing didn't help, neither the jarring score which punctuated scenes. The audience is left none the wiser about the 'Father of the bomb' nor his motivation or humanity. Clever word play and lingering shots of Murphy wearing the signature wide brimmed hat won't make up for the deficiencies. Such a shame."

27 July 2023,10," "" I belive we did it ""
",/review/rw9218650/?ref_=tt_urv,"Who was Oppenheimer? Seemingly, we see an ordinary man, a student who wants to succeed and be somebody. That his knowledge is studied even after him. To leave something to humanity that would help them develop further in the future. Fight diseases, famines, wars. Basically, what is the goal of comprehensive science? The development of civilization and its progress. Helping the individual as a human species to rise. What did J. Robert Oppenheimer with his work? He brought death. How and why? To stop more deaths. Did he regret his invention? Not at all. He enjoyed the glory, he gave new energy to humanity. That can help. Tomorrow that weapon can be used to deflect an asteroid that would destroy us. He regrets that he placed his child in the hands of those who did not use that knowledge for the benefit of humanity. To the powerful, for whom human lives are just numbers, and those who realized what they had done are - cry-baby, as one character said. Here, in addition to all that, we see a classic biographical film. Very well woven, with a few flaws. Some of these are the large presence of music in scenes, where it is placed in scenes where someone is talking. It is constantly heard. When characters like the main one are walking, they enter the room and music is there. No need. That's what wasn't needed on that scale. Another minus is that the start is a bit slow. Not meeting him at the university, which was really cool, but all that getting into the story around the Manhattan Project. I get the impression that Nolan did this on purpose to inflate the film to a three-hour running time. Like the old epic classics. But this film, when compared to today's commercials that overwhelm us, can comfortably be called an epic classic despite some flaws. Many singled out the absence of women as one of those. They are even in some way well depicted considering the time and the work the main characters in this story deal with. The tension is brilliantly portrayed by the anticipation of the atomic bomb test and what happens afterwards. After that, you have one scene as well as the ending itself, which can comfortably be called the best in the film. The scenes of testimony before the committee and congress are reminiscent of courtroom dramas and thrillers. Cillian Murphy rocked this role, he portrayed Oppenheimer perfectly. He might even win an Oscar. However, Robert Downey Jr. Stole the show. A great performance of his character, Strauss. I think that if he doesn't win an Oscar now, he never will. It would be completely deserved. Emily Blunt is also good in the scenes where she is represented more. She did a great job on this. Matt Damon, smarmy, brings the humor. Gary Oldman is excellent in that one scene. Rami Malek, very small role and silent. All in, a movie that you will love if you are a Nolan fan and love this genre. I can say - the best movie of the year so far."

",/review/rw9202503/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity."

One might assume that this movie is about the atomic bomb and the impact *the bomb* had on the world stage, but it's really about the people, specifically Oppenheimer and the US government. Nolan's decision to omit the dropping of the bombs in Japan was the right choice, as it really demonstrated this film is about Oppenheimer, not the bomb. As such, the ending tied everything together into a neat bow that summed up what the bomb really meant in the evolution of modern society beyond the point of material destruction."

It was fascinating and the size of the cast and big names impressive. Maybe I missed something but it took 3 years to collect enough material to build the first bomb then suddenly after the successful detonation, 2 new bombs are ready to go. How?

That being said, the movie was made in such a way that kept me engaged the entire time. The soundtrack was amazing, and the transitions between the scenes coupled with the beautiful views of explosions and particles (not using CGI) kept myself holding my eyes open with the fear of blinking for even the smallest amount of time. I do not think the acting could have been any better, and the tense buildup to the trinity test - as well as the final heartbreaking line said by Murphy at the end - was constantly gripping my full attention. In almost every scene I was wondering what would happen next in terms of Nolan's artistic capabilities, and never was I disappointed. When a historical drama can keep you glued with your eyes open the entire time, despite the fact that many of the events portrayed are known to us today, it's very difficult to rate it below a perfect score. The impact of this movie is still making me ponder with wonder about the life of Oppenheimer. This movie is a perfect example that a depiction of one real man can leave people in awe, admiration, and deep thought."

However, I am very disappointed that a movie that probably has cost a lot of money to make, did not even bother to check whether the Dutch (scene which was shot in Leiden) actually made sense. It was in fact, not Dutch, but German. This, especially considering that the timeline was during WW2, is shameful.

The threat of nuclear weapons is existential, and is always in the back of our mind. The portrayal of this in this film is incredible. Not to speak of the incredible cinematography and writing by Christopher Nolan. The way that the explosion is set out, it represents the mid point of this film rather than the end. It is a very powerful moment, and the sounds and images are just incredible. Nolan also intertwines three timelines, before the bombings of japan, the present (set in the time of these bombing), and after them explaining the repercussions that Oppenheimer faced and the way that the US dealt with this. The ending is even more powerful, and even received applauds from the audience. An incredible movie that i think is one of the highlights of this decade."

The only disappointment is Gary Old man, who had been so excellent as Winston Churchill but here plays Harry Truman like a caricature. Besides the cast, the editing is also amazing.

The movie is ae easy 9/10 purely for the sake the trailer let the movie on to be more linear. The movies only downside is the constant cuts can sometimes be hard to follow, however, those aspects allow for an abundance of re-watchability.

There were some quirky dialogue lines throughout the film, but were easily washed out by the sheer beauty of the cinematography and performances by the rest of the characters.

The performances from all the cast are amazing and they make the characters truly believable, but Cillian Murphy shines the brightest as he finally gets the lead role in a Nolan Film. His performance is worthy of an Oscar Nomination if not a win. This film is a 100% go see! Watch it in IMAX, it's an incredible experience.

Cillian Murphy had a similar impact on me. Ludwig Göransson's score was perfect and will not let you miss Hans Zimmer. Screenwriting is something Christopher Nolan has mastered since Memento. Can we call Oppenheimer Nolan's best work? I'd say no! But this will be considered a film that is unique from the other films he has made. Can we call it Cillian Murphy's best role? A big yes! Because of the superhero movies, we often forget how great an actor Robert Downey is. As Lewis Strauss, he blew everyone's mind! Magnificent actors, Incredible storytelling and Engaging music.

This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing.

Infrequently picking up civilian radio transmissions, the nuclear-armed submarine was too deep to be in sync with the outside world, to know if war had already been broke out, as it's been busy hiding from American naval pursuers. Captain Savitsky and the Political Officer Maslennikov, risking the chance that a war had already begun, decided to launch a nuclear torpedo, the authorization of which normally requires only the confirmations from the two officers. The launch, according to military estimates, would have caused a chain reaction, resulting in a thermonuclear conflict destroying the better parts of the northern hemisphere. With reputations preceding him, Executive Officer Vasily Arkhipov utilized the special circumstance requiring the confirmations of all three officers, objected to the launch, preventing the onset of nuclear war. Roughly 20 years later, a similar fate was averted when officer Stanislav Petrov at the command center of the Soviet early warning system Oko decided that the multiple reports of intercontinental ballistic missile launch were false alarms, disobeying military protocols requiring him to relay the alarms up the chain of command (at the likely cost of his entire life and career), otherwise leading to a retaliatory attack with unimaginable consequences."

He spent lots of time developing Oppenheimer and just the right amount with other characters such as Lewis Strauss. The cinematography was on a whole different level. Definitely Oscar worthy. Different colorings for different time periods was a very smart choice, and it helped me understand the movie a lot better. During a scene with yelling, the contrast got a lot brighter like a bomb detonating;). You can also see objects shaking in the background the louder it gets. The acting by everybody, even a character who was in one scene storming out of a room, was amazing. Cillian Murphy was the perfect casting choice for a character like Oppenheimer. He conveyed the emotions extremely well and is definitely deserving of at least an Oscar nomination. Nolan really outdid himself and all the hype paid off. I have one slight criticism and that is that there was a very brief period of time near the beginning of the movie that seemed to move a little bit fast but since the movie was 3 hours, it didn't bother me very much. All in all, movie of the year, decade, and maybe even century. Don't believe me? Go watch it and you're sure to be speechless as soon as the credits roll."

The acting was on point. I personally thought the pacing was very good. When a 3 hour movie feels like an hour an a half long so thing is done right.

I can clearly say this is a piece of art with its multi-dimensional narrative style and engrossing concept. A thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of scientific advancements and the complexities of human ambition. The film's thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of scientific advancements forces the audience to ponder the moral implications of innovation in warfare and the enduring impact on humanity.

The layer of music over top of the voice track was too much and made for too many missed words. All along I kept wishing for closed captioning so I could follow the story. For a 3 hour movie I completely expected more action. Sound decibel level was impressively loud. I expect some cinema grade loudspeakers got blown and probably startled a few Barbie movie goers in the theater next door. Time will tell if this was a hit.

I've been looking forward to this movie since July 2022, but I; intentionally; did not read or watch any media about the film. I read the book 'The General and the Genius' some years back (the film is based on American Prometheus), so my expectation was that the film would center around the relationship between Oppenheimer and Groves. That was not the case. Instead we get a deep dive into the man that was J. Robert Oppenheimer. This alone lends itself to a more abstract storyline, with which some may find it hard to follow."

It's boring, overdone and chaotic. The timelines intertwine so that you can't figure out what times you are watching. We watch characters talk to each other and discuss what others have said. Oppenheimer himself has been made into a slightly crazy type who basically doesn't know why he is working on the atomic bomb. I still don't know what his motivation was, it was so hard to tell from the acting. Well, that's right, the acting. With so many excellent actors, Nolan gives us such flat and poorly drawn characters. Oppenheimer's wives, in particular, look like characters artificially glued to the plot. They might as well not have been there and the film would have lost nothing and gained nothing. Unfortunately, I will not recommend this film. It is probably the worst Nolan film I have seen."

But outside of that, it's all talk and talk. They are also suspicious of historical data that were previously secret. We hope it will be nominated for an Oscar, even though true stories are almost never awarded.

This movie has such a great pace and keeps you on the edge of your seat for 3 hours straight. Oppenheimer is a must-see in IMAX! Probably the most amazing aspect of this film is that Nolan achieved the effect of detonating an atomic bomb without the use of CGI. Film making at it's finest. I'd put this film up for BEST PICTURE next to 'Sound of Freedom'. Also, there was VERY little gore or violence, the R rating was mostly for nudity and language, that would turn-on anyone whose into sapiosexuality and the choice of actress totally fed into that as well, my fellow comic geeks will love that Black Widow treat.

I haven't been this excited in a while that I purchased an Imax ticket months ahead of time.

Unfortunately, I feel it was a little too long and should have ended soon after the atomic bomb was a success and Oppenheimer comes to grips with the powerful self-destruction creation he made. Instead Nolan chose to drone on about Oppenheimer's bureaucratic problems he encounters and beats a dead horse on the moral problems he comes to grip with. I felt it was answered enough in the previous 2.5 hours and I admit I was beginning to clock watch and wondering when it was gonna wrap up. All I can say is that Nolan is indeed the greatest director of this generation but peaked with Interstellar for me which was truly a top 10 film. That movie deserved multiple viewings with a similar runtime but keeps you engaged the whole time. This I feel comes up way short behind his other masterpieces such as Interstellar, Dark Knight, The Prestige, and Inception."

",/review/rw9218287/?ref_=tt_urv,"Such a captivating film throughout. Theres a lot of information and dialouge to this film but each scene is short and fast paced, like it resembled the pressure and urgency of their task. The short, fast paced scenes keep you interested and on the edge of your seat as the film builds and builds up to the point of the test. My only critism is the explosion itself, although the sound was okay, it didn't feel as dramatic as there were a lot of loud scenes leading up to the explosion so it felt underwhelming in comparison. I also feel that the visuals of the bomb was slightly underwhelming. However, I believe Nolan didn't want to use any CGI for the explosion so considering it was done with real explosives, it was still impressive. Nolan never fails to suprise me with his films. A must watch."

22 July 2023,9," A sobering, but wonderful film
",/review/rw9206089/?ref_=tt_urv,"Nolan's greatest weakness as a filmmaker has always been found in the convoluted stories he tells. When he gets lost in parts of it to a level that the story itself gets lost as well (see: Tenet). By the nature of this story, he was already protected from that. With that safety net in place, he soared to wonderful heights. This may well be the best cast he has ever assembled for a film, and they carry it beautifully. It is a deeply troubling film that causes us to look ourselves in the mirror. Is the prize worth the price? This will undoubtedly, and deservedly, garner several Oscar nominations, as it should. This very well could go down as Nolan's greatest film. A wonderful achievement given his catalogue."

Christopher Nolan has outdone himself once again, creating a stunning biopic that explores the life and legacy of one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. The film is a visual feast, shot in IMAX and 65mm film, with breathtaking cinematography and practical effects. The cast is phenomenal, especially Cillian Murphy, who delivers a career-best performance as the brilliant and tormented J. Robert Oppenheimer. The screenplay is smart, complex, and emotional, weaving together historical facts and artistic liberties in a captivating way. The music by Ludwig Göransson is haunting and powerful, enhancing the mood and tension of every scene. Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the praise and awards it can get. It's a must-see for anyone who loves movies, history, science, or just great storytelling. It's the best film of 2023, and possibly of all time."

Murphy, we watched how Oppenheimer was, how he did not want to stop his achievements, how he always wanted to support science and be a pioneer, and how much he enjoyed being promoted professionally.

It is truly admirable how the film delves deeply into moral themes and how its messages impact and move the audience, leaving an indelible imprint on the human psyche. The unique narrative of this film far surpasses any other production based on historical events, even if the latter may not be rigorously precise. However, it is precisely in this imprecision where its charm lies, for the film does not seek to be a mere documentary; rather, it is an emotional and profound portrayal of a range of feelings experienced by the protagonist throughout the film, including guilt, resilience, anguish, and many others."

After reading some reviews I thought it'd be challenging to keep up with a few timelines but it was a breeze, the pace although on the fast side makes for compelling storytelling. The score and sound are perfect and exactly what you'd expect from Imax, the well placed/timed loudness adds to the experience and makes this a well constructed immersive look into the life of a controversial historical figure.

I was riveted by Dark Knight, Interstellar and Tenet yet Oppenheimer and Dunkirk far more so saw emotional resonance with the characters and care for the films outcome lacking.

Since I am not an expert, I am not going to delve deep into the cinematography and I am pretty sure there aren't many people that are in position to criticize or evaluate Christopher Nolan when it comes to that. For me, personally, the action felt too fragmented at times, which disrupted the flow of the whole movie too much and left me with this unsettling feeling that the story could have been told better. I understand the logic behind the retrospection and I know that this technique has served Nolan beautifully on previous occasions, nevertheless I reckon it was exploited too much here.

You know when a movie directing by Christopher Nolan,you gotta see that movie on IMAX that's an unwritten rule and I can easily say this was the best IMAX experience that i've ever had. The quality of sounds was made me feel like I'm inside of the movie. Especially,this cast OMG! Even the less important role in the movie was played by an actor who has at least Oscar or any award. Probably only Nolan or Tarantino would bring them together and seeing this movie,learning all kinda things about the facts in the history was an indescribable experience."

Christopher nolan and cillian Murphy is a good team. Hope to see MORE from them in future. Specially the bomb explosion moments. And the story before that. I really felt so real at the moments of Oppenheimer's shock. The regret of him. Those moments were really good. I loved the cinematography. And robert downey junior's acting was top notch. At first i couldn't even recognise him. He was totally in the character. And florence pugh was amazing as well. So many favourite characters together. Felt like ""avengers end game last scene"" everyone was there. SO GOOD!!!"

",/review/rw9238086/?ref_=tt_urv,"OPPENHEIMER, starring Cillian Murphy and directed by Christopher Nolan, is definitely a treat for history buffs, but this film in particular is about the origins and/or the summarized development of the atomic bomb and therefore everything that shall come after, but really this film explores majorly the psychological turmoil of its subject: Oppenheimer himself, all during an age of McCarthyism and quote-on-quote government-sponsored censorship of not only entertainment, but political dissent. Blacklisting, Defamation of Character, Violation of Civil Liberties. Only Objection: Too Long, 3Hours. Pacing in On-Point for an Educated Audience. Not for the Lowest Common Denominator. Still Accessible - Acting Onpoint - Traditionalist Through and Through. This is What Keeps It Going - Straight Dramatic, Eye Contact - Cunning, Thrilling, and Mysterious At Times and Selectively Downright Philosophical. END OF REVIEW."

21 August 2023,7," Very good but maybe not exceptional
",/review/rw9273929/?ref_=tt_urv,"Here's what I liked. The acting was superb. Cillian Murphy (Who is this guy?) was outstanding. Oscar winning performance. The supporting cast was terrific including Robert Downey Jr. You felt the characters were real. Only Matt Damon's role felt forced. The script was intelligent (for the most part) and it's a good story. Nuclear weapons is admittedly a touchy subject and the movie kept its balance until the last hour when it became a tad one-sided. The short scene making President Truman seem like a bumpkin was disappointing, for example, even though I read that a couple of quotes he said in the movie were true. Still, it made me wonder how historically accurate the movie was. From what I read, Oppenheimer was more flawed than the movie indicates, and I left the theater wondering what kind of man Oppenheimer really was, besides being a competent director and a womanizer. I also thought the use of imagery showing what Oppenheimer was thinking at times was too speculative and overdone. All said, this was a good film which offered a lot. However, it's not Nolan's best movie, in my opinion."

",/review/rw9208815/?ref_=tt_urv,"Up until Dunkirk, I loved Nolan's films. I saw Interstellar 3 times in the theater. The Dark Knight trilogy may be my favorite in the superhero genre. I had high expectations going into Oppenheimer. Sadly, I was falling asleep and checking my phone by the end of the first hour. So boring. The only thing in this film maybe worth watching only when it's available at home were the performances. Murphy and Damon mostly."
21 July 2023,9," This is definitely a Christopher Nolan film.
",/review/rw9205438/?ref_=tt_urv,"I just watched this movie, and it is an ambitious film in portraying Robert Oppenheimer. The cast which you may know were in the movie and some you didn't know had small roles were all excellent. I thought Murphy and RDJ were the standouts. The one role who I thought seemed superfluous was Florence Pugh's character. To me she didn't seem too vital to the story aside from seeing her boobs in IMAX. Nolan could've put anyone in that role, and it would have had the same superficial effect. Aside from that the only quibble I have is the score is sometimes so loud that I could NOT understand what some of the characters were saying. As for the rest of the film it was relentless in telling Oppenheimer's story. It was as well made as cinema can get nowadays. You were absolutely immersed in the mid to late 40's . So much so that if you aren't a person even mildly knowledgeable about the subject then you may get lost as this film does not hold your hand in explaining what is occurring."

",/review/rw9223009/?ref_=tt_urv,"Wow, what a monumental & sensational film! Nolan reinvents the three-Act structure to extraordinary effect. Oppenheimer is an intense and thrilling film that grabs a hold of your attention from the first frame and never let's you go. A mesmerising and powerful drama that unfolds like a thriller; Nolan builds the tension to a breathtaking climax, but thereafter does not let go, when it morphs into a thrilling and tense courtroom drama. The performances are all uniformly incredible, but Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Junior, Emily Blunt and Jason Clarke are the clear standouts. Every performance is a fully realised characterisation. Nolan has crafted a masterful film with the highest technical achievement, from the cinematography, to the production design, to the film's epic and haunting score from Ludwig Gorranson. This is Nolan's masterpiece!"

One watch is always not enough...

You will leave the theater certain that Oppenheimer will likely never be surpassed in terms of quality. I loved it on Imax and I hope the Imax brand can stay true to a collection of movies displayed on it that are at the top of the class in cinematography and an provide interesting historical events or insight into what our world and universe have to offer.

However I do believe the film is a bit unorganized and is largely saved by good performances and great cinematography, at least up until the last one-half to one-third. After that, the story takes a more ""traditional"" route and cleans everything up nicely, barring a few things which I wish were done differently."

What I can say is that I expected little from the movie Interstellar when I saw it, and due to my ignorance, I didn't imagine it to be a Nolan movie, except when it was late and I had already loved it. I would say that the engaging narrative and the construction of tension are primarily responsible for my passion, but today I would argue in favor of Nolan's masterful direction, which has been perpetuated in the present film.

At the second watch I understood everything the timeline in the movie was alittle bet hard to understand but when yous see that for second time its wow . Cillian Murphy's performance deserves oscar , even his eyes was acting he was really the best cast . Robert Downey Jr. I wished he has more scenes but his scenes in the second part of the movie was really good and I forgot that I am watching Tony Stark. Mat Damon and Emily Blunt were also lovely. The most thing I have loved in the movie is the sound effects it made super atmosphere. Finally I love to say Nolan is GOAT."

",/review/rw9207104/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer is an excellent personal history and a story of international cooperation in physics. There is an interest in philosophy and morality, but no understanding of the actions and consequences.

Has an Amadeus touch to the story line. Cinematography, lighting and camera work is superb and lends itself well to the story telling. Nolan remains customer obsessed as ever, treating his audience with intellectual respect. The actors are extremely good and the best compliment to them is that you don't feel them. Only thing which could be better was the music."

",/review/rw9211322/?ref_=tt_urv,"Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece, as it started out, but was quickly changed the tone when nudity was added in for no real reason at all. It honestly took away from the overall character of the film and ruined getting a pg-13 rating which would have been able to be seen by even more fans. It felt like something added in by producers to get more views or add something spicy to the content. It film was unreal, the acting was amazing, and the overall feel of the movie was left confused by the length and seemed drawn out more than his other films. It could have been a hour cut off in just unneeded dialogue."
31 July 2023,3," Lot of internal US politics than science
",/review/rw9228918/?ref_=tt_urv,"I was expecting something like Interstellar, but not 15 minutes of Quantum Mechanics, Nuclear Physics, or any sort of Physics throughout the entire 180 minutes of the film. Instead, there were lots of internal politics and spying investigations of the US Government at that time. As I am not North American, I couldn't relate to all these backstories regarding what went wrong with Oppenheimer back then. I will surely accept that it was my mistake not to check the genre of the movie. Apart from that, I didn't like the usage of the Sri Bhagavad Gita in the movie. They could have shown him reading it in the lab or something. Also, when Jean Tatlock asks him 2nd time to speak Sanskrit script, again Murphy just translated it."

The last 45 mins were a bit much for me, so I'll take away a star for that. Also the nudity was unnecessary. You could have communicated the romantic tension without it, so I remove a star for that as well. Doing a little research on the biography of Oppenheimer afterwards, I believe the movie was very faithful to his character and personal life. Over all, I believe Christopher Nolan's film was a masterpiece that will always be remembered positively. As long as that movie was, I can't wait to see it again."

The movie is tasked with answering a single question throughout the entire movie: Is Oppenheimer a man to be trusted? The development of the movie is very well designed. Oppenheimer is a complicated man, with strong beliefs and who is entitled to those beliefs, and yet he is constantly interrogated for not just being the man who invented the atomic bomb, but for whether or not he is being loyal to America. Forces beyond his control and people who plot against him, but he has the wit and strength of a scientist who must prove to no one that he is in fact human."

The editing simply made me sick as if I was in a speeding car on a windy road hitting lots of bumps. The acting is 10/10 and the quality is impecable. I kinda wished the movie had shown some insights into the Japanese side as well, like maybe the story of a simple family living in Hiroshima, for example, to get some balance and more nuanced cultural insights and sides to the same story. It felt so unilateral even with Oppenheimer's hallucinating guilt. The main antagonist in this story is some guy playing political tricks I didn't care about which just made the story difficult to understand or get emotionally invested into at times."

It gives great insight into the time period and the man's life. The whole movie flows seamlessly, and definitely deserves to be watched multiple times! One of the most incredible things that I realized 2/3rds of the way in, is that the actors did such an amazing job that I truly forgot it was the same actors for the majority of the movie. I truly dropped my jaw remembering that Cillian Murphy is the man planning Oppenheimer, but also played Scarecrow (in Nolan's BatMan Begins); they feel like two completely separate human beings! The only one who felt like himself was Robert Downey Jr., but that was pretty much because he was the only one who didn't have a completely different voice from his usual self. Downey Jr.'s performance was still magnificent to be clear! The whole movie is truly a masterpiece and should be remembered as an American classic!!!!

It may not suit everyone's taste, but I'm sure whoever loves this type of movie will like it. The cast was amazing, elite actors. Cillian Murphy's performance was amazing, he mastered the role of Benheimer more than him 😂 and he also gave the character his own flavor because of his unique facial features. In short, the movie is worth watching the money and time It is also not suitable for children under 13 from my point of view, but I wish they showed the effects of the nuclear bomb on the human being from the center of the bomb until the last trace of it."

",/review/rw9215247/?ref_=tt_urv,"Made an account just so I can hype up this masterpiece. The movie is a must-watch. Had me hooked from the very beginning. Nolan is an incredible director and even though I understand that some people may have had slightly different expectations, this movie serves incredible atmosphere, character complexity, story progression and depiction of monumental historical events, without any hint of romanticization. The cast was picked perfectly and served amazing acting. Personally I didn't find it too long, in fact it didn't feel like 3h at all. Would strongly recommend watching it in theaters rather than waiting to stream it at home. Also wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not into history at all. No need to be a history buff, but would recommend looking up the some information about the Manhattan Project and everybody's involvement just for a better feel of the plot, though one can watch the movie without any prior knowledge whatsoever. The plot is rounded-up beautifully and it sparks further need for discussion and thinking, without feeling ambiguous."

And I don't get any point about those two naked scenes. Literally it doesn't help anything but make the film level to R . Oppenheimer is one of the greatest scientists ever . And he doesn't know if he made this the government wouldn't throw it out ?it's so joke when they said cuz culture they don't throw it to Kyoto. Like peoples life are nothing than culture.
3 August 2023,5," A Fissil Film
",/review/rw9235528/?ref_=tt_urv,"We came away from watching Oppenheimer with mixed reviews and everyone agreed the movie was confusing. First, the narrative about a famous, soft spoken American is masked by ""mood-music"" throughout most of the film. As a result, the viewer is forced to read lips in order to understand the plot. Second and typical of Nolan's films, the plot skips around to the point where it becomes difficult to follow. This Hollywood ""Hop-Scotching"" produces audio & visual enhancements, but it also shrouds the spinal message of the movie. Additionally, the film also contains dozens of actors making it impossible to track who is who and what their positions are. Oppenheimer is technically accurate but not smooth in its presentation. I would recommend to those who have't seen it to read up about Robert Oppenheimer beforehand so you can gain an appreciation of his controversial biography. Oppenheimer is worth seeing, but it'll be awhile before I'll view the film again, perhaps with captions, so I can digest what message Nolan is trying to portray. Non-fictional movies about a major historical event shouldn't be fragmented in its message, as the Trinity test suggests."

This movie did touch on some of the thinking present during that time leading to the decisions. I enjoy learning, reading, and watching anything to do with WWII.

20 July 2023,7," Nolan Explores A New Genre
",/review/rw9201998/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan is a mastermind at coming up with novel concepts like in Inception, Memento and Tenet. That's what makes him Nolan in my humble opinion. He has also proved to be a genius when it comes to action fantasies like in The Batman Trilogy. Nolan is also the best when it comes to thrillers whether they are sci-fi thrillers such as Interstellar or war thrillers such as Dunkirk or psychological thrillers such as The Prestige and Insomnia. So he experiments with different genres and here he is, yet again, embarking on a whole new genre, biographical movies! Most biographical movies are boring, lame and empty but this one is the best biopic I've ever seen. I mean, the black and white scenes, the loud bombing in the IMAX theatre, the storytelling and the phenomenal score in the background, all of that fits together really well in a 3 hour screenplay that takes you away from reality and makes you lose your sense of time. When the credits rolled I was in shock knowing that 3 hours had just passed by because to me it literally felt like 30 minutes. It was unbelievable. However, I think Chris Nolan is poor at writing drama. It's his biggest weakness and unfortunately Oppenheimer is only about personal drama so it doesn't have any aspects at which Nolan could show his strengths. The drama in Oppenheimer was not deep enough and didn't hit hard enough. I would give it 7.5/10 but this website doesn't allow fractions so I can only choose between 7 or 8 and I went with 7 haha. I think you can find poor drama in all Nolan movies as well but that's not always obvious because most of his work is not about drama alone unlike Oppenheimer. The most obvious example is Tenet, it doesn't have any emotions or drama and If not for the brilliant concept in Tenet, the whole movie would have been a total waste of time. I don't know how can Nolan improve in drama writing. It's the only flaw in Oppenheimer. Nonetheless, I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan and I enjoyed watching Oppenheimer."

They may be the type of people that you personally have never met, or ever will, yet you still see some common human element between yourself and the character/s in question.

The movie doesn't shy away from the ugly and disturbing but it doesn't show it directly but Nolan lets our imagination run amok putting bits of information that are like a partial puzzle which we complete in our minds. Can't say a bad thing about Nolan's work or this movie he had more beautiful ones but never so human and never close to us.

The jumping around between scenes combined with the booming soundtrack underneath made it extremely difficult for me to understand what was happening at all times. I'll have to watch this again, at home, with the subtitles on. That being said, the third and final hour of the movie absolutely blew me away. Wow. We already know Oppenheimer made the bomb. We know the bombs were used on Japan (and WHY didn't Nolan show us that!??) But the AEC security commission review ""trial"" and the Senate nomination hearings for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr's role) could have been a standalone movie all by itself and I loved it.

So I'll talk about the bad things first
After I came out of the theater I was perplexed ,jarred,astonished by this sheer creation. But I wasn't able to entirely attach myself with the character of Oppenheimer. I think non linear timeline works very well with a thriller ,political drama, scientific discovery with a race against time ,but it wasn't able to bring out the vastness , depths of oppie's character. So what we've got is an edge of the seat thriller at the expense of deep emotional connection with the protagonist,like when you see Forrest Gump you feel like him, life actually becomes a box of chocolates,when you see Shawshank redemption you want redd to find where Andy is and their union brings tears of joys to your eyes. But in Oppenheimer when after a long legal battle you remember how the pawns are placed and power game is played ,director doesn't give you a breathing moment to understand Oppenheimer's own version. Was he a commie? Was he not ? Who knows ?"

Even with 3 hours long, it never felt like more than a 2 hour film, because it was so intense and you are so deep in the trama, that you dont see the time flow.

The music is not far behind, it accompanies the scenes very well and manages to create that drama. One of my favorite scenes is when Oppenheimer gives his speech in front of the participants of the Manhattan experiment in Los Alamos after breaking the news of the ""success"" of the Atomic Bomb, it is here where we see the change of thought and behavior of a man who, trying to save the world, started a war worse than he expected.

Blunt is amazing as is Murphy. Experience this in 70mm. The world changed in ways we still cannot fully understand, and everything else changed with the revolutions in science and thought.

Happy to see that against ""Barbie,"" a movie about history was doing relatively well-theater packed. But this movie was done in typical Christopher Nolan film, most shots lasting 5 seconds or less resulting in a jumping narrative style, that when combined with the technical jargon and the too loud ""Hans Zimmer-like"" soundtrack made it difficult to understand, even for a physics-degreed guy wearing hearing aids."

If Christopher Nolan known for reality instead of VFX why doesn't he used real video reference and create separate scene for that movie. Before releasing, there was a hype about this movie because of Oppenheimer use the Geeta phrase after dropping the bomb by US army that was a reason, I was curious about to watch this movie but if you are not aware about physics & history, my suggestion for you do some RND first then you can watch this movie otherwise you will going to sleep on the chair.

Casting has been perfect and you must spot mainly Cilian Murphy , Robert Downey ,Emily blunt and Matt Damon. Nolan gave significance to each detail of these characters . The explotion and the physics behind is shown in an intersting way. Oppenheimer's psychological state before and after bombing has been observed closely. The political tensions at that time and the egocentric attitude of leaders are shown well. Casting has just been perfect and an average cinephile may know all.

Also, the timing cycle, the shifts, twists and turns of telling the life story of him(Oppenheimer) was brilliant. That's the success of the director and the whole team. Moreover, this film is worth watching. Although it's more than 180 minutes, I don't think anybody will feel bored.

Endgame being 3 hours made the audience sir tight every frame but it's the exactly opposite for Oppenheimer.

While Nolan shows respect to his audience by providing a challenging plot to keep up with, viewers must actively listen to all the dialogue to follow along, a task which lasts the entire 3 hours. While the music and some of the visuals are great, the characters were not likable. Their complexity was evident but somehow non of them were relatable. The plot was detailed but seemed somewhat revisionist. The communists, the Japanese, and the protagonist himself were shown to be unjustly victimized.

What I disliked most of all was the nerve jangly, incessantly loud and constant soundtrack noise. I know Nolan likes to do this but it was out of control in this movie. It was like leaving your teenage boy to play death metal at full bore whilst you are try to meditate! I must have looked at my watch 50 times as to when it would be over. I very much appreciated Nolan's storytelling talents, and the excellent acting, but seriously, edit this movie please. I suggest a test audience cut instead of the directors cut."

The movie covers every aspect of his life, his highs and his lows, his selflessness and his pride and strives to achieve an accurate depiction of an character as complex as ""The father of Atom Bomb"". But it's not just Nolan that shines in this film, almost everyone on the screen is at their best. Cillian's portrayal of Oppenheimer must be his best job till date and that isn't an simple statement considering the actor of his caliber, so do Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr. In their roles. Camerawork and Sound is another thing, Christopher Nolan has mastered, and like his most other movies, Oppenheimer is no different when it comes to

Every minute is interesting as Nolan himself stated. I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar. This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him. Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.

Oppenheimer is a movie that you have to see on the big screen, as it is a spectacle that will blow you away. It is one of the most movies that I like, and I'm sure you will agree. This movie deserves all the praise and recognition it can get, and I hope you will give it a chance. Trust me, you won't regret it."

What a way to start this rollercoaster. Christopher Nolan has more than succeeded in giving his audience what they expected with the epic biopic Oppenheimer, in which he revisits World War II after Dunkirk. As with all of Nolan's films, with the exception of a few glaring points, this is undoubtedly one of the best blockbusters to come out in recent years. While expecting a more understandable and plain editing compared to Nolan's other films since this being a history film, Oppenheimer was perhaps one of his most difficult films to follow.

24 July 2023,8," A powerful film
",/review/rw9213294/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan proves once again why he has become such a well renown and respected director in such a competitive industry. The hype for this movie was real and as much a product of Nolan's incredibly reputation as it was the subject matter and man the film was based on. The movie is a slow burn and harkens back to an older style of film that Nolan has become so beloved for in an era of CGI bloated blockbusters. Void of CGI and overblown set pieces Oppenheimer is akin to an older film simply because it is carried by its drama, themes, and outstanding cast performances more than it is by spectacle. The cinematography is second to none , using both visual and audio cues to tie into the films deeper themes. The one that comes to mind is the stomping that Oppenheimer hears in his head throughout the movie that grow louder and louder almost like an oncoming train , the source of the sound that tortures him for most of the movie is revealed closer to the end. He is also haunted by quick cuts and flashes of the bomb exploding and fire expanding etc etc. Before the trinity test scene even happens. The way the trinity test was presented was tasteful. Going on premiere night in a sold out theater, you could hear a pin drop in the room during that scene. The movie tackles heavy subjects as Oppenheimer wrestles with moral qualms and guilt over what he helped create. While powerful I do believe that the latter half of the movie involving a hearing for Dr. Oppenheimer with regards to his ongoing security clearance for the U. S. and it's nuclear program could have been condensed a bit. While I do believe that the tail end of the movie used it's time effectively to bring some weight to the movie after the trinity test and tie together some strong themes that become clear by the end. I do believe that these hearing scenes could come off as long winded at times. At best the latter half of this movie and thus it's run time is appreciated by those not bothered by long run times , who likely enjoy other long dramas in vein with Oppenheimer like The Godfather, Scarface, and more. Even those not normally used to sitting in the theater watching a movie for so long might find the film and the superb performances to be engaging enough to justify its runtime. At worst Oppenheimer suffers from an ending that feels drawn out and caused the pacing of the film to suffer. Some modern audiences who do not understand or appreciate much of the important historical context to this movie as well , might find themselves bored sitting through what feels like a court hearing towards the end of the movie. For those type of moviegoers , they probably came to see the spectacle of the trinity test scene, likely thinking it would be a finale of sorts. But on the contrary the trinity test scene merely serves as catalyst to move into the second half of the movie (thematically) speaking. I suppose the latter type of audience is not who Oppenheimer was intended for exactly. If you are a fan of film, if your a history buff, If you don't mind a slow burn and enjoy a good character piece with some good drama and themes, then Oppenheimer is a great movie for you. If you are someone who didn't know who Oppenheimer was before they announced this movie, if you don't care much for history , If your a casual movie goer whose looking for an action packed thrill ride or just decided to check it out to see what the hype was all about... then you might get mixed results. Best advice is to tailor your expectations accordingly. For me this movie was not perfect but it came pretty damn close. It's cinematography, themes , character studies, historical significance, actor performances, audio work, and of course Nolan's signature dedication to practical effects combine to deliver a film that weights up to the reputation of a man who for better or for worse changed the world as we know it. This movie solidified Nolan's place amongst names like Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick and more... in other words the best of the best Hollywood has to offer! Nolan is one of if not the last of a dying breed of director. His contributions and dedication to his art help keep the original spirit of filmmaking alive at a time when the majority of what we see in theaters encompasses very little of what made the roots of the art form so compelling and special."

",/review/rw9207052/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer is not a typical Nolan films like Inception or Interstellar. It is a three hour long biographical thriller film which was running like a fast moving car. As an IR student i've found it very relatable but thats not the case with most of the Indian audience. This movie has lot of characters like Strauss, J Hoover, Roosevelt, Kennedy and many more American scientists. You should have fair idea about their role in American history then only you could relate it better. First half was very much setting up the plot of the film which revolves around Oppenheimer's Journey. But the second half right from the ""Trinity test"" to the mystery of the end was an absolute amazing. The background score was tense and will held you till the end of the movie. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey have given their career best performance. Eventually, all i can say it is more of ""Dunkirk"" kind of film rather than Dark Knight or Interstellar. If you love watching serious cinema then it is a must watch movie, you will surely enjoy it."

",/review/rw9221122/?ref_=tt_urv,"First of all, everything that follows is my personal opinion, everyone can have a different opinion and that's a good thing. The complexity of the film is a major point of criticism for many, which I can understand in some ways, although I see it differently. Because the complexity of Nolan's films is why I love them so much. It's a change from the dull action films that are too haf produced. It is true that Oppenheimer is also mentally demanding and makes your head pound, however me and my 4 friends (all 15 years old) enjoyed the film very much and learned a lot about the story of this brilliant man and the film despite the well understood at different time levels. Not completely, of course, but you have to be prepared for that with a Nolan film. One can't rave enough about the acting cillian murphy and robert downey jr's performance was absolutely superb and definitely worthy of an Oscar. The rest of the cast is also incredibly strong. I thought every 5 minutes ""what? You're playing too?"". And as if that weren't enough, everything is staged in an absolutely grandiose way and during one scene my mouth just dropped open and I just asked myself ""how???"". And last but not least, the absolutely ingeniously adapted music makes every single scene perfect."

The cinematography subtle change led to an even more emotional response to these amazing actors. Casting was amazing and ""Kitty"" and her character were crucial to understanding the mental stress that he was trying to process. She was the sanity check in his unbelievable world. Tellar, I think represented all of us, going along for the ride and trying to be decent people, but still afraid to speak out against what might feel wrong in the world but also wanted to make a name for ourselves as well. Even the fact that it was mentioned, be it small, that the land should go back to the native Indians that occupied it before he bought the land, was true to history. Nowadays, it crucial we tell the truth and not hide from our ugly history. We are who we are. Go see it."

But what I got was 90% politics, and 10% actual blockbuster. It's sad, because I was expecting to see more of the bomb, or the suffering of the Japanese, but all we got to see was 5 seconds on the tv that the bomb hit it's target. We where forced to see 2 hours of building the bomb but only 5 seconds of the actual impact? What's the last hour for then? It's all about Oppenheimer still having his seat on some absolutely boring politician whatever. And they even made the second part more important than the first one? Who cares about that. I was expecting to see some Christopher Nolan, tenet level like action or something but I got an documentary. I know I'm too harsh, but there were ways to make it more epic. It's not even creepy or anything it's just plain boring. And Downey Jr. As a villain? Doesn't work for me, don't know about everyone else. The movie was one hour too long, everyone ran out of the theater after 3 torturing hours. Movie was good, especially the church scene, but not 8,0/10 good."

Robert Downey Jr. Was so good as Lewis Strauss that you will feel the urge to punch his face. Words cant describe how amazing Cillian Murphy's acting was, you really need to see it to judge it.

The movie moves quickly while tackling significant themes and giving a thorough character analysis of our culture. It was one of the most frightening scenes in recent memory, making theatergoers uneasy and serving as a reminder of the full power of the film experience. With a remarkable cinematic achievement and a poignant reminder that cinema is still alive, Oppenheimer is a winner on all counts.

I felt it to be slow paced and confusing at times with a lot of things happening at once. It honestly felt like a documentary. However, I also like close to one of the world's 30 cinemas that project the movie in IMAX 70mm and I had booked the tickets a month earlier. When I tried to get a refund and cancel the tickets after watching the movie the first time, the customer service at the cinema said that they couldn't cancel my ticket at the moment, and the cancellation was only possible after the movie had been played and my ticket shouldn't be scanned.

",/review/rw9232084/?ref_=tt_urv,"So let's start with the good bits: A fascinating story well told and easy to follow despite the usual non linear format of Mr Nolan. I also thought it ended well and had great acting and a brilliant cast. I would have given it more stars had it not been overhyped so much which left me with my expectations too high. Now for the bad bits (with spoilers!): Watching any film on a Cinema big screen with surround sound is a nice experience. However, I am not sure why this film was a 'must see' on a big screen. I am guessing for the overhyped bomb detonation taking place two hours into the three hour film. I was expecting so much more from the detonation sequence, I did not time it, but it seemed to be over so quickly with a flash, fireball and some shockwave bangs. Mr Nolan missed a trick here as he could have made it last so much longer with so many more effects. Then it was back to the slow but well told drama for the last hour. So, with the exception of a couple of minutes in the middle a big screen is no more a required for this film than for a courtroom drama."

This masterpiece does not appreciate its existence outside cinema halls, especially IMAX, Finally, the film is not for fans of action ratings. It tells about Oppenheimer's autobiography in the Manhattan Project, and how his life was before and after the bomb, with regard to political issues, betrayal of the country, and physics as well, where you will live a very nice experience in case you have a background in history regarding the issue of the American and Russian allies.

Einstein and others convinced president Roosevelt that Germany was in the process of developing an atomic bomb and it was Roosevelt who decided to launch the Manhatten Project. It was also Roosevelt who sent a letter to Oppenheimer thanking him for leading the successful work in New Mexico.

Cliché-depicted the life of a scientist, the female role etc. I believe that with such great performances and interesting historical events, the movie should have been way more thrilling. Another thing is, that when you create a movie about the life of a physicist, it is essential that you comprehend at least the basic knowledge required and not just throw random stuff in the script.

Everything in this movie is simply perfect, like every Nolan's movie we can find the time notion representated by clock sounds throughout the movie. Cillian was just the best choice for this, he plays Robert Oppenheimer like a deus and he knows how to reach people's heart thanks to his facials expressions, we know instantly feel the differents emotions of his character. We come to realize the remorse that Robert may have had after the launching of the A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in a very psychological short scene. Psychology is an integral part of this film since it is centered on a character in thirst for creation who does not realize the harm he could create by doing so. In short this film is quite representative of the works of oppenheimer and i strongly invite you to go see it."

All the other actors did a fantastic job as well as their role I could see that all of the actors knew what they were doing.

",/review/rw9313587/?ref_=tt_urv,"Overall, the film is fine. A particularly positive aspect, as with all Nolan films, are the special effects. The soundtrack is also well done. For the most part, the film is treated as a biopic, although it deviates from that in a few places. For example, while there is a focus on Oppenheimer's development and becoming a professor of physics, especially in the beginning, it becomes more and more impersonal as the film progresses. So in the end it is not a biopic of Oppenheimer, but rather a biopic of the atomic bomb itself. Apart from the few historical inaccuracies (Albert Einstein did not play as big a role for Oppenheimer in real life as it is shown), the film is accurate. However, the long dialogues, which some people criticize as ""boring"", are more of a plus for me, especially compared to past films by Christopher Nolan, which placed more emphasis on visuals. As already mentioned, the film unfortunately becomes more and more impersonal and in the end only relies on long scenes in court, in which the events are once again replayed by already known characters from their point of view. I expected much more. I think the film could have been much better if Nolan had focused more on Oppenheimer's psychological problems after the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At least, I would have found that more interesting."

",/review/rw9230347/?ref_=tt_urv,"First of all, I am a big fan of Nolan's works. I like most of his movies and The Prestige remains one of my favorite. I wish I liked Oppenheimer too but the movie came as a big disappointment to me. Probably because I expected to see an epic drama about the intricacies and difficulties of building an atomic bomb (something like The Imitation Game or biopic like There Will Be Blood about personality of Oppenheimer) but instead I saw ""Michael Keaton"" walking around and smoking pipe performed by Cillian Murphy. I like Murphy's other roles, but I don't think this one was his best performance. The moral dilemma Oppenheimer had been going through was not convincing at all in Murphy's play. I didn't see that something was really eating Oppenheimer - Murphy even after he realised the scale of his destructive creation. No obsession with atomic bomb or quantum physics was shown. So disappointing. I wish the role was played by Eddie Redmayne or Benedict Cumberbatch. The movie is unreasonably too long. Too many unnecessary scenes. More than half of the film is devoted to the interrogation with predilection whether Oppenheimer's clearance will be renewed or not. Is it a joke? Was it the most important thing in his life? Really? No chemistry between Murphy and E. Blunt's characters, so it was pretty surprising that they got married. However, I gave the film 6 stars because I absolutely loved Robert Downey's performance. He was stunning from start to finish. Casey Affleck should have had longer screen time. I also think that Florence Pugh's character was underdeveloped. She is so talented and beautiful and could have brought better sense and scenes to the film."

",/review/rw9229451/?ref_=tt_urv,"I got out asking myself if the movie was not too long. But thinking it twice, the narrative frame is so good that the 2h45 seemed not so long and the global story was not annoying or boring...of course Nolan could have cut 30 minutes to make it more mainstream but the film editing is great. A contemplative experience as usual with Nolan but Cylian Murphy is so good and Robert Downey is a credible Lewis Strauss. I would not view it again on TV but I would pay for 70mm version in theater. The pre requisite of non using special effects can be disturbing as we are waiting for that bomb to explode for 2 hours but the outcome can be disappointing for some people. All in all, a great balance between Nolan genius and a lovely biopic."

Also the detonation of the device where a little bit underwhelming consider the trailer, besides it's hard to reduplicate without cgi.

The final sequence after the explosion had some really good scenes. The talk with the president that shows the ruthlessness and corruption of the government and president. The internal conflict Robert had between saying what the people wanted to hear and the feeling that he caused the death of millions. The whole interrogation thing was pretty lame and and the result didn't affect me. None of the characters were very interesting. Strauss was a character that seemed cliché a guy that hates someone and wants to bring him down and has a breakdown saying that the guy is evil and wants the fame and everything. Dr Oppenheimer was also a very average character and probably was the best as well in the whole movie.

There's really no development of the characters. In one instance, Kitty Oppenheimer, Emily blunt, is seen with booze and ignoring the house hold, and just unkept. Which applause to Emily blunt for her acting, she did a great job given the lack of material she was handed for the role.

A shame really, considering my interest in Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project. Take everything Dunkirk did wrong, or at least what I didn't like about it, and pack it into one movie. This movie chose to put emphasis on showcasing the filmmaker's skills instead of putting focus on telling the story of Oppenheimer's life. It seems the love interests and sexual scenes just try to breathe life into a somewhat lifeless story. I believe this is the film where we see the beginning of the end for Christopher Nolan. Maybe he's just lost his touch? Maybe he's been doing it so long, he's making the films more for himself than for his audience."

The movie continues with his research and it is all out in extraordinary view. Oppenheimer makes an outstanding young physicist and you can see his growth as he goes from Cambridge to Germany. This sequence was put together so well as he met new characters and spent a minute or two introducing them to the audience so they may be of importance later in the story. He begins teaching and later the bomb is found to be a possibility. This is where the complication begins as you go from his future to the future with Louis Strauss and they talk about things not seen yet. As Groves come to him with an idea of the directing of the bomb his past begins to unveil with communism in every corner. It is in this phase when the movie gets extremely complicated. He begins collecting scientist and Los Almos is soon made. The complication begins to unveil just as in every Christopher Nolan movie. Oppenheimer's clearance is questioned and you see Strauss at his own council meeting. He begins making the bomb and it is here where Christopher Nolan builds tension to make the movie so much better. The tension between the scientist as he builds the bomb is outstanding and makes the movie so much more realistic. You can understand how important this is and how vital it is to get everything correct.the movie takes a very political turn here with Japan about to be attacked and the tension grows when they find the bomb could destroy the world. Finally, they are put to the test and the bomb is exploded. Here is when the movie starts unraveling just as all Christopher Nolan movies. You find Strauss is the master mine between the clearance problems and you understand the council meetings with both Robert and Strauss. The moment you understand the whole movie makes sense. In the end it is heartfelt with his past and get a moral dilemma combined with politics, and physics. I love how it is all complicated and emotional yet it all makes sense in the end."

The fast transitions between scenes tied together with constant background music makes it almost unwatchable. The first 90 minutes felt like going through some IG reel where everything had to be hyped up to keep people interested. Not each and every line the character says has to be epic. Not each and every scene needs epic music building up to create tension. The movie feels flat from this point of view. It keeps running on high octane. Where are the moments of calm that help build up the tension? It's just tension in almost every scene. It feels so unnatural and out of place. The second part of the movie feels a bit better. Robert Downey Jr. Does an amazing job, so does Murphy. It's the pace of the movie that's the problem. I would have had no problem watching this as a mini series like Chernobyl.

This is the first point. The second point is that the movie is about Oppenheimer. The movie does not talk about the nuclear explosion or the world war and the battles. No, the story is a biography in Nolan's style. The movie was excellent in terms of dialogue, beautiful story, and also characters. My only complaint is the exaggerated marketing of the movie.

First of all, I expected a lot more insights into various challenges or hurdles these scientists have faced while trying to come up with the atom bomb and how they overcame those. None of that was shown. Given that this movie is being made in 2023, there is huge scope for showing the trinity test in a much more impactful and fear-inducing way. What we instead see is a silent explosion that is not even close to the scale I was expecting on an IMAX screen. Yes, it is close to reality as all the scientists were witnessing this from 20 miles away, so they wouldn't hear the sound first but I didn't go in there to see a documentary. And the whole third act tested my patience. It is continuous rambling and talk from various characters without any emotional connect or impact.

",/review/rw9205756/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie was incredible. Extremely gripping right from the jump. You're immediately thrown into the life of J Robert Oppenheimer and his complex life and mind. The movie doesn't hold back when it comes to pace. All scenes and dialogue feel like they are shot out of a cannon, but it just further accentuates how jam-packed this movie is with information and flare. The 3 hour run-time was no issue even for somebody such as myself who tends to get bored when moves push longer than 2.5 hours. The movie almost feels like it's more around the 2 to 2 1/2 hour run-time due to how entrenched you become in the story and the overall characters. The movie can be very jarring with how technical some of the dialogue and nuanced discussions between scientists can be. Nolan doesn't try and dumb down the movie for the audience and really respects the intelligence of the viewer. A second viewing almost feels necessary to discern every character and minutiae the movie has to offer, but I wont be waiting long to indulge in that second viewing. Please go see this movie, even if you already have an idea of how some of the actual historical events took place. It's well worth your time and well."

",/review/rw9205792/?ref_=tt_urv,"I have never written a review on this site, nor had I planned to until I sat down and watched Oppenheimer. I was floored by its effortless genius and masterful writing. The movie takes the viewer on a turbulent, frankly disturbing ride, that leaves you jostled, depressed, and stunned. A cinematic experience that goes unmatched. A cinematic experience that I hope is not overlooked by the often ignorant Oscars. The film easily cements itself as Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. The directors usual tricks that often make his films at times fall flat, work wonders here. From the entirely practical effects to dialogue overload that in his other films feel hollow only fuel the fire that is Oppenheimer. Techniques that make me overjoyed that Nolan was the director to make this movie and not someone else. If you have not seen it, I urge you. Yes, it is long, and yes, it is not an action filled blockbuster, but it is something better. A movie that tells a story that changes the way the viewer perceives the world we live in. Because isn't that what art is supposed to do."

I can understand why some people may find this boring as its dialogue heavy and very little action but i thoroughly enjoyed it and knew what to expect going in.

",/review/rw9206315/?ref_=tt_urv,"I am biased towards historical period pieces as history often tells the most human stories and movies exaggerate these stories for dramatic effect. Nolan understands how to to paint a memoir of Oppenheimer without rose tinged glasses. You won't find the conventional action in this but the words spoken carry a much more compelling conflict than any car chase or battle. This is more about my love for the genre but Nolan made a great historical time piece, and to be Honest, got a lot of help from the uniqueness, complexity, and significance of having one of the most interesting men, Oppenheimer, live during one of the most interesting time periods, the 1930-40s. However these traits are a double edge sword as a lesser team would have fumbled all the details onto the screen, making the audience unable to pick up the pieces of such a complex puzzle. One more thing to remember, THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT OPPENHEIMER, NOT THE ATOMIC BOMB so don't think the bomb is the focus of the movie, it's only one chapter of Oppenheimers life. That being said go out and watch Oppenheimer to support other historical movies as history tells the most compelling stories.

It makes every explosion or metaphor for Oppenheimer's thoughts even more strong than if they were computer generated. Also the montage of the film is truly marvelous and innovative.

",/review/rw9204790/?ref_=tt_urv,"At the beginning, I think that most people thought that this movie is about the nuclear bomb and there will be many explosions, and I am one of the people who thought that there would be explosions, because of the marketing and the hype in this film were saying this, but it is very logical that there will be no explosions other than the experimental explosion unless Oppenheimer Participated in the war but he didn't, I may not like biographical films much unless I am interested in the person, and in Robert Oppenheimer's life I am more interested in the nuclear bomb. Perhaps if the movie was about the nuclear bomb and focusing on it, it would have been better, i missed the first 10 minutes of the film but the beginning was normal for me like any other biography, I like the conflict with his life , with jean and his friend and kitty, and the interior conflict that caused after they dropped the bomb in Hiroshima, This shows you the act that comes with regret later on, The climax in this film was so powerful and touched me and deserved to watch it on 70mm IMAX screen but only this scene d: ,The speech scene after they dropped the bomb, After that there was an inner struggle scene that Nolan showed us visually in a very cool way, i see that 3 hours is a lot for this film , it could be better than that in my opinion, the cinematography and the soundtrack ill not say anything about it i mean it's so good ofc, the editing style i didnt like it so much and i feel like it's messy, And I think Nolan is obsessed with time and decided to use editing to play between past, present and future, it's not like the editor is bad or something no but i felt this method didn't work with me, When I missed the 10 minutes, I felt that I had missed something because i didnt understand what happened when they went to the B+W , so I started thinking about what I missed, and then at the time I was thinking about, the future tense appeared and I said holy shit wtf is this, and I missed the time while thinking about what i missed but i got it quickly because I know Nolan he loves to play with time , but i think people don't know him they will take a lot longer to realize what is happening."

My love for Christopher Nolan's work and being a huge fan of majority of the film's cast incited me to watch the movie on the first day itself. If I were to give a review in one sentence, it would be ""Either you will truly love this movie or greatly appreciate it but nobody will hate it"". Everything about this movie is top-notch. The casting, cinematography, direction, background score (which will take your breath away) and pretty much everything else is phenomenal with great attention to detail, something which has become a standard for Nolan's work. Just half hour into the movie and I said to myself that I am witnessing something special. There were more than two times in the movie, when I was genuinely left with my mouth wide open and eyes mesmerising at the screen. If you are interested or have spare time at your arsenal, learning something about the life about the main character and World war 2 in general would be helpful, although not compulsory by any means. It will just help you better understand the nuances of the movie and better grasp it without getting overwhelmed with the introduction of different characters. At the end, I would finish the review by saying that this is truly a cinematic experience, which needs to be enjoyed in a movie theatre in order to properly appreciate the great effort that went behind this now critically acclaimed project."

Wonderful acting, powerful score and really good storytelling are just some of the many great things this movie had to offer. A very educational film as well as riveting, but the one major word I have for this film is, tragic. A group of men and women who changed the world in the deserts of New Mexico, who worked a miracle that would shape the future of planet earth, only to have their creation used for war and death ... this film was more of a warning than for entertainment purposes."

Yes it's 3 hrs, but honestly what adult can't sit and watch a film this good for few a few hrs. It's Not like they aren't sitting around somewhere else on there butt.

",/review/rw9206536/?ref_=tt_urv,"In my opinion, the film Oppenheimer is one of the best films in the history of the film industry. I've never felt an explosion in a film as much as I did in Oppenheimer. In my cinema I could literally feel the pressure wave. In addition, the plot of the film was written and filmed absolutely perfectly. You were emotionally taken a lot and the events were presented in great detail and accurately. For this reason, I cannot understand many of the criteria, for example. Either you don't have patience because the film is so long or many don't understand it because they don't have the necessary intelligence to be able to understand the film, because otherwise you would give the film at least a 9.0. As for the acting, I can only say that it was an absolute champion performance by everyone. I also take my hat off to the absolutely legendary execution and direction of Nolan and the film's producers. Thank you for letting me sit in such a masterpiece."
15 August 2023,9," If you didn't love the first time, you will the second
",/review/rw9260409/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer directed and written by Christopher Nolan is truly one of the best films of the past decade. My first watch I found myself loving every aspect of a Christopher Nolan movie. The image as always is clean and gorgeous, you can feel the IMAX. The storyline is nonlinear and challenges both your attention and comprehension, a very rewarding way for a director to think high of its audience. Finally the score, where before the GOAT Hans Zimmer has more than once amazed us with his magic, Ludwig Göransson returns from previously working on Tennet and gives an absolute masterpiece. Ive been listening to the score since my first watch, and listening to it again on my second made me love it much more. And that is what happens with the rest of the movie. Although I loved every technical aspect on my fisrt watch, I did found myself agreeing with my friends that the movie could've been made shorter and even a little lighter. Although I argued that its length and constant bombardment of information was no reason whatsoever for a miss in the movie, I didn't argued enough on its behalf for elevating it and become much more than a historical movie. At the end, my first watch was an amazong movie with room for improvement, maybe for an easier watch. How I wish I never said that. It is only on my second watch when truly every detail is rich and powerful and meaningful. Where first I found empty space or simply overdoing of a scene, now I found a whole new spectrum of the movie. If you felt similar on your first watch, or you thought you would've love it more, do yourself a favor and give it a second watch. Christopher Nolan crafted this movie with every expertise he's gathered throughout his entire carrier. You can see his experience on Dunkirk, Inception, The Prestige, Insomnia, and pretty much his entire filmography put together on his yet most ambitious film. It feels he's been preparing for this movie his whole life. The acting is phenomenal, specially by Murphy and Downey, I can see them both wining the oscar easily so far this year. The thing most people will have a problem with and it was my little nitpick on my first watch will be the script. Being too long and too rich with information may fall like a very overwhelming experience and I can truly understand that. I above all argue that this is not a movie for anyone, you must commit to it, truly, but if you do it rewards with a very immersive and terrifying experience. And that END. I don't care if you like movies or not, if this was for you or not, but if you didn't marveled a the end with the amazing score concluding the destruction of the world, I don't trust you. In overall, I truly think Christopher Nolan made his masterpiece, I think he out did himself on this one and stepped out from his comfort zone (if you could say that) making this historical and yet inmersive study of character experience. A film for the ages, only time will tell if it truly is Nolan's best, now I could argue that is his second or third, but that may be the hype, or may not."

",/review/rw9206752/?ref_=tt_urv,"One of the best cinematic experiences of all time. Everything from acting to directing to the cinematography is really really good. It challenges you as a person and it leaves you feeling an emptiness inside yourself. Robert Downey Jr was outstanding and his monologue at the end is too good. Cillian Murphy was excellent as always and Emily Blunt as well. The trinity test sequence is absolutely phenomenal while obeying the laws of physics of the speed of sound and light. When you hear Oppenheimer's iconic quote ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"" it will give you goosebumps and you will enjoy that moment. Overall a great cinematic watch. I definitely reccomend watching it in theatres."

",/review/rw9212341/?ref_=tt_urv,"I was highly anticipating this movie since the trailer dropped earlier this year since I was a big fan of Nolan's Dunkirk. Going in, I was scared that this movie wasn't going to live up to my expectation but by the end I could say that it has surpassed it. The visuals were truly spectacular, the score was fantastic, cinematography even more so. Cillian Murphy's acting was very good as J. Robert Oppenheimer. I felt that he encapsulates the character of Oppenheimer very authentically and makes him a very complicated figure that we could all sympathise with despite being the father of one of the most destructive weapons that humanity has ever created. All of that couldn't have been done without Murphy's acting. The side characters were also pretty well played by their respective actors with my favourites being Lewis Strauss played by Robert Downey Jr. And Albert Einstein by Tom Conti. All of this combined making the movie one of the most engaging that I have seen for quite some time in theatres. 10/10."

",/review/rw9211346/?ref_=tt_urv,"This could easily be Nolans best work yet or ever. The only nit pick I have is the audio mixing with music and dialogue that Nolan has struggled with in his past couple movies, is still a slight problem here. Other than that, the casting (Cillian and RDJ are oscar bound), epic music, dialogue, cinematography, storytelling is all a masterpiece. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT THE ATOMIC BOMB. ITS ABOUT OPPENHEIMER. Nolan tells the story of oppenheimers insane life pre, post and during the war to perfection and Cillian Murphy makes you feel everything he went through along the way. At no point did I feel like the movie was dragging because it has a breakneck pace that could be tiring but it keeps you glued to the screen. If you don't give yourself the chance to see this movie in theaters (IMAX preferably), you are robbing yourself of an opportunity to see one of the most important movies in recent memory."

But both combine for something that will go unmatched for a long time. An honest biopic about Robert Oppenheimer that doesn't provide any answers because there are no easy answers. Instead, it lends to the audience a masterwork of a story worth pondering over & over. This goes above Nolan's past best works in Dunkirk and Inception, not only due to the refined wizardry of Nolan's genius but also to the nature of what the film sets out to explore -- that momentous juncture in human history when we couldn't mathmatically rule out that we, as humanity, could destroy ourselves in the very attempt to save ourselves--with all of our human complexicites webbed throughout."

And make no mistake, this movie will haunt you. And terrify you.

Beautiful to watch. I don't think there is any cinematic genius than Nolan. 3 hours is action-packed for people who want to watch. For the name-sake views it's just low grade. I've seen people sleep in the first half and all of a sudden it got interesting in the second half. Nowadays people can't understand setups. You can't make a 3-hour film full of explosion scenes.

",/review/rw9215178/?ref_=tt_urv,"The character assassination of Julius Robert Oppenheimer is a much described and debated subject, and it's basically also what this film is about, I think, and little about nuclear bomb making. Nevertheless, though it's nearly three hours long, director Christopher Nolan still tries to fill the plot with more than is possible, and the results is that it stylistically appears like an endless trailer, where the editing and the jumping in time looks more like a long music video than an epic film. At times it becomes distressing to watch, and it's a great relief when this cannonade of pictures takes breaks in a few longer and slower sequences. If the intention has been to illustrate the main character's inner life during the process, it's perhaps reasonable, but this great topic would probably fit better as a mini series. However, Cillian Murphy makes the very best out of it as Oppenheimer, and despite the aggressive editing he manages to build a credible character. Sadly it doesn't work too well for several other characters, who also are more or less miscasted."

",/review/rw9256395/?ref_=tt_urv,"In my opinion, it's Nolan's greatest film thus far, and my personal favorite movie in general. It's a very impactful visceral experience that makes you feel strong emotions of awe, concern and wonder. You think and feel about humanity throughout the film and it's difficult to stop thinking about these feelings after you leave the theater. The actors and story remind you what it means to be human, with people's everyday emotions and feelings like calm, hope, love, glamour, lust, sadness, empathy, jealousy, chaos and hatred. Yet you also feel the immense fragility of humanity due to our potential for barbarism, conspiracy and self-destruction at the level of the atomic bomb, while also feeling awe for our ingenuity, intelligence and glamour in our scientific and artistic pursuits in life. These contradictory feelings of the nature of human life are interwoven with each other and it makes you ponder how complex, beautiful, serious, grandiose, important and precious our lives are. The film is made all the more potent once you realize all of this, developing and using atomic bomb, and for the most part, happened, and this is who we are, and you are viewing, to some extent, reality, when you watch the bomb explode and observe the human circumstances arround it. Cillian Murphy does a great job as Dr. Oppenheimer, as do the others. I highly recommend seeing it in Imax to get a bigger screen and a louder Soundsystem to fully enjoy what I believe is a once in a lifetime achievement in cinematography, acting, soundtrack and sound editing."

",/review/rw9301606/?ref_=tt_urv,"I'm going to have to watch it again. There was so much going on in this film, it was hard to keep track of everything, but that's alright with me. It certainly was not boring. I was mildly irritated by the psychological scenes that depicted imaginary chair sex, and an imaginary charred body, because technically Nolan broke character, which is against the rules in good acting. I forgive you this time, Nolan. You're forgiven because I understand what you were trying to tell your audience. Many thousands of people suffered terribly and died from this nuclear bombing. The weight of the guilt must have been a crushing burden for all people involved. This must have caused some psychiatric problems for all involved. We really feel that in our bodies throughout the film. I learned so much valuable information from this film, it was worth the effort to sit for three hours in a theater seat. I really liked the film because it gave us a view into the past. We got to see the ordinary daily life of people who had a very powerful influence over the second world war. They had ordinary daily struggles just like us: alcoholism, lust, cowardice, a desire for power and prestige, and fear of failure. Oppenheimer was so thin, I wonder if he knew what a powerful effect he had on other people. We see early in the film him struggling to make his way in life, wondering if he is going to succeed, advocating for unions and fighting with his peers over it. We really feel the sense of urgency as they all struggled to make the bomb before the enemies of America got it done first. As with all new ideas and new technology, there's always a lot of struggling just to understand what is going on, and what is going to happen. Nolan makes this very obvious. As we watch, we can feel in our bodies the same tension that Oppenheimer felt as they all worked on this project. I liked three hours of film because it gave me more time to think about the whole era. We have the right to defend ourselves. It's a great struggle to balance this idea verses the idea that the end never justifies the means. Forcing Japan to surrender caused more problems than it solved. We know this from medical records from the war. The dead bodies spread disease to everyone. We already know that Albert Einstein never imagined his work in math and nuclear theory would lead to a bomb. He warned the United Nations not to build bombs with his ideas on nuclear theory. I can't help thinking to myself that these nuclear scientists were all working way too hard. The proof of this is the way their work in math was used to hurt people. I'm working from some assumptions. I'm assuming these folks did not know for sure that they would succeed at building the bomb. I'm assuming they were all new to nuclear technology. I'm assuming they were innocent, because my country's constitution assumes people are innocent. I like that idea. I think it's worth defending."

Even though Oppenheimer is a biopic, Nolan still manages to deliver a beautifully crafted story about a complex and morally gray genius. Though I believe this was a little too dense and could have been shortened up or made into two different movies, it still manages to keep your attention throughout your viewing. Nolans style is at its absolute peak and creatively intelligent. Along with beautiful writing, comes an expertly assembled cast. Cillian Murphy absolutely brought everything he had to this role and it shows. Robert Downey Jr. Finally gets to show his immense talent and range. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh give convincing emotional performances and really embody their characters. Every actor is absolutely spectacular, and it enhances the movie so much. Cinematography has always been a key part of Nolans films, but this movie's visuals are utterly stunning. The camera work and practical effects leave you with a sense of dread and fear of what Oppenheimer created, but that's also thanks to the intense audio mixing. All in all, Nolan has made the film of the year. He has shown that a movie doesn't tell just a situation, but an actual story. Oscar worthy is an understatement."

I left the theatre today not to claps or conversation but it was silent, and the reason I was silent is because diving into that story and the mind of Oppenheimer it really shows how complex of a time it was and leaves you in a grey area, up to your interpretation.

The casting, the soundtrack, the plethora of talent in this movie is exceptional to say the least, and I believe that audiences will be thinking about this movie for years to come.

",/review/rw9289962/?ref_=tt_urv,"As one of the younger audience members (21 years old) I grew up in the world of fast and action overloaded movies. This isn't that type of movie. Cillian Murphy's brilliant embodiment of Oppenheimer allows us to get to know Oppenheimer as a versatile, rational but still passionate character. During the whole movie his intellect and sharp mind stays undisputed. While Oppenheimer, as said above, stays really rational in nearly all personal conversations, the way he talks about chemical procedures doesn't leave the shadow of a doubt that this man was at the top of his field and you fall in love with the character more and more during the movie. Even though his emotions are often more implicated than shown you get a deep understanding of Oppenheimers moral compass. With Downey Jr. As a Strauss you got the perfect antagonist. Getting to know him as a brillant mind and a strong supporter/ admirer in the early stages of the movie makes him an even better antagonist in the later stages of the movies."

",/review/rw9217765/?ref_=tt_urv,"In ways that only Christopher Nolan can do, Oppenheimer is a layered, critical thinking film with A-list surprises, brilliant cinematography, and a hell of a sound mixing team. There's history, there's science, there's humanity- it's all there for the viewer to interpret as deeply (or superficially) as they like. I love Christopher Nolan because I feel I can trust his work; sure there's some suspension of belief (it is Hollywood after all), but you know you'll walk away from the movie lingering on subtle scenes, powerful dialogue, challenging morals, etc. There's always always something to think about and relish, and Oppenheimer does not disappoint!"
24 July 2023,6," Just a 6 for a near perfect film.
",/review/rw9211554/?ref_=tt_urv,"Ok let me start by the obvious ratings which were thoroughly written and explained by the previous reviewers. I will be brief:
Oscar for best Direction : Christopher Nolan
Oscar for best performance by an actor in a leading role: Cilian Murphy
Oscar for best Screenplay : Christophe Nolan
Oscars for best supporting actor : Matt Damon and/or Rober Doweny Jr
Oscar for best editing : Jenifer Lame
Oscar for best music : Ludwig Goransson
Oscar for the most unnecessary casting to an unworthy Oscar holder: Rami Malek
Etc etc etc...
So why the 6 then: Because the film is unnecessary. Its about something that already happened, and we are all aware of (take for example the atomic bomb first testing scene in Los Alamos). It's a biography of a person that we cannot relate to because his character (as depicted in the film) is two-dimensional. The film's subject matter is boring. Its very well written but its unnecessarily too long. And finally because it didn't manage to provide) any sort of feelings (well ok apart from some arousal in the unnecessary sex scenes). I believe that Nolan's next film should be about Psychedelia and it's influence to humanity in a Philosophical, Sociological and Spiritual level (as Kubrick did in 2001: A Space Odyssey). I'm sure that with a film like that, he will be able to use show his full spectrum as a Director and as an artist."

I was surprised at how much emphasis there was on the post war witch hunts and hearings, where Oppenheimer was basically being denigrated every which way but loose, and I shouldn't have been as I've read American Prometheus, and the film is extremely true to the book, and that was quite a heavy read.

The acting was absolutely phenomenal and reveals the tension in each scene. The attention to detail with the historical details and physics terminology is further impressive such as the sound from the trinity test occurring a bit after the bomb was detonated.

Too boring - the movie was too boring. It tried to excuse Oppenheimer of his contribution for eternity at destroying lives, but pointing that it's the politician who is the real killer...

In the first part of the movie Oppenheimer is in the Netherlands at the University of Leiden where he gives a lecture in Dutch. He learned it in 6 weeks. However the language that he really speaks is German. And I should know because I am Dutch. Somehowe in most American movies they think we speak German in the Netherlands. The movie itself is interresting but sometimes a bit chaotic with the timelines. If I ever will see this movie a second time? I think I will pass. 7 out of 10 rating is the most I van give.

Leslie Groves, made up stories (the poisoned apple, the Einstein conversation), and a pain inducing, punctuated-moment volume level employed as a snore prevention mechanism. My theater's audience was like a zombie convention. No one moved. No one laughed. When I walked outside to the freedom of the early evening sun I did laugh as I exclaimed ""They got me! Classic."" To be fair though, the popcorn was top notch. It's sad that Hollywood is so desperate to duplicate the ""only in theaters"" modus to success demonstrated by last year's Top Gun Maverick that they'll use every trick in the book to get us in there. When they have to sell it as the heaviest roll of film ever made ""it's a 600lb IMAX reel!!!"", you know the movie has some real problems. Halfway through, I begrudgingly admitted to my wife that we should have seen ""Barbie"", and rented this. I wish we had.

It doesn't have a mind boggling script or outrageous Scientific Theories (well subjective) that is because it's a Biopic. It is not going to show what already hasn't happened . For me the best thing a biopic or historical piece could do is to potray it good enough so that most of the people watching it gets the idea of it.

My opinion may be biased because I love Christopher Nolan's work as well as the work of many of the actors in this film. It is very historically accurate, people complain about sound in Nolan films but I don't have a single complaint about the sound for this one. The way this film is structured may confuse many people, there are a lot of cuts in the beginning and end but it is not made too difficult to understand. I watched this with a friend that had nearly no knowledge of Oppenheimer other than his greatest achievement of course and he understood basically everything in this film. The entire cast did a brilliant job, especially Cillian Murphy. It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr. Actually push himself and reaffirm his talent. I cannot recommend this film enough to anyone.

Oppenheimer has incredible cinematography and sound, but lacks sorely in narrative. The actors did what they could, which I might say was a fantastic job, but Nolan simply couldn't keep focus on a few but compelling narratives, but instead shot off in all kinds of directions with multiple plots. It caused an incredibly exhausting and, dare I say, boring experience. Let's make something clear; a movie has to first and foremost be entertaining and then it can layer the entertainment with visuals and sounds. Oppenheimer did it the other way around, except the entertaining part never actually arrived."

The camera movement and the switches between black and white and colour makes the movie way more exciting and realistic. Also the clean and thoughtful cuts let the film be very philosophic. Honestly at the end you are mindblown and it all makes sense. Because the film is so philosophic you have to think about it after the film ended. All in all a great movie.

Also the visual effects are so good (especially during the opening sequence and the cambridge dreams). Also einstein is such a cutie patootie i love him so much i want to shrink him and put him in my pocket tbh he was so adorable. Also they brushed over the fact that oppy tried to kill his teacher a bit too much for my liking but ig its not my movie... anyway i just want to thank the hairstylists for giving cillian murphy curly hair as a gangly 20 year old i really appreciate it beyond words tysm chrissy. Anyway jean deserved better tbh she was such a girlboss slay queen and they turned her into a sex object which i did not appreciate #justice4jean anyway the casting was sooo so good like it felt like that bit in animal farm where the animals look from the pigs to the men and back again and they can't tell the difference yeah it was like that. Anyway speaking of casting can nolan pls stop casting cillian murphy in really traumatised roles. Leave that poor man alone his thousand yard stare is getting a bit too realistic for my liking tbh #savecillian2023 OMG have u guys seen that video at the premiere where matt damon accidentally bumped into cillian murphy and cilly turned and gave the camera the most pained expression i have ever seen its so funny. ALSO. The costuming in the movie was sooo good i recently found out that oppy's (cool way of saying oppenheimer) costumes were inspired by david bowie which explains why he looked so absolutely snatched in that one scene in los alamos anyway i read a really sad article where emily blunt said that poor little cillian murphy only ate one almond a day (heartbroken emoji) #yolandahadidcore anyway that one scene on the train where his shoulders looked really small and his head looked really big. Yeah. Anyway. Im sure everyone is waiting for me to talk about the sex scenes. Well i am. ""now i am become death destroyer of worlds"" why did she make him read that while she was. U know. Also the hearing scene was so awkward because they were talking about jean and then the camera panned around that one guy and i KNEW oppy was gonna be naked when the camera panned back around and he was and also cillian murphy has so many freckles ANYWAY not the point but it was so awkward because florence pugh was just staring at emily blunt with the most (REDACTED)-out expression it was so awkward. Anyway. Speaking of emily blunt she absolutely DEVOURED that roger guy. ""16, 17, no, 18 years"" GIRLLL ATE HIM UP AND LEFT NO CRUMBS. Also the way they were talking about communism like it was worse than/equivalent to facism like stalinism is different to communism girlypop! #readyourtheory #dialecticalmaterialism #uncleanoosh ANYWAY i cant remember the ending of the movie very well because i had spent the last third of the movie absolutely sobbing my eyes out because i was so upset. That brings me to why i deducted two stars is because if you're a bit sensitive like me the movie is actually a bit of a hard watch tbh also it's not the kind of movie i'd watch again... sorry nolan... it's an absolute masterpiece but it really is so emotionally draining. Also don't watch it in a super crowded cinema because i had such a bad headache for days afterwards because i was trying to had not to cry loudly. 0/10 do not recommend anyway. I probably already mentioned this but cillian murphy is such a good actor like his screen presence is so magnetic you just can't help but look at him ALSO the fact that he is sooo so good looking im sorry i know that that's not the point of the movie but gahhdamn that man is fine. Anyway rami malek was a bit of a jumpscare and i thought it was really funny that david hill defended oppy despite oppy always flipping over his clipboard lmao #justicefordavidhill anyway OH MY GOD I ALMOST FORGOT TO TALK ABOUT STRAUSS. Robert downey jr was so good in this movie and tbh i hear some oscar buzz anyway strauss (pronounced ""stross"" be careful out there everyone, i got clowned on for pronouncing it like strauss sad face) is such a silly little guy and also really annoying. ALSO im just now realising that i genuinely have no idea what oppy's hearing was about. Like genuinely no idea. I also missed like a good 10 minutes of dialogue post hiroshima because i was so shell shocked. Don't really ask me what happened after hiroshima because i was seeing the screen through blurry eyes as i was. Slightly emotionally affected by it. Which is a slight understatement. ALSO RODERICK WAS IN IT? He was throwing up outside after oppy's speech and i related to that so hard tbh there was one point where i was so upset i felt like i was going to faint. Probably the most disassociating experience is walking out of oppenheimer feeling nothing short of shell-shocked and walking into an ocean of pink. Jesus i felt like i needed a cigarette. Anyway it was an absolutely amazing movie but wayyy too emotionally draining to warrant another watch so i had to deduct two stars sorry :(( if they released a cut that was just up to the (but not including) the trinity test i would watch that again and again but the last third of the movie is just so harrowing. Maybe i should watch it again in the comfort of my own home just for some sort of catharsis because i feel a lot of pent up emotion about it because you know it isn't exactly deemed socially acceptable to sob and wail in a cinema is it. Maybe it is idk. Anyway i was the only girl in my cinema which made the sex scenes a bit uncomfortable because of the overwhelming masculine energy emanating from my screening but i digress. Also make sure to, if you're a girl/feminine aligned person, wear a super brightly coloured outfit to confuse all the men and make them think you're in the wrong movie it's funny asf. Also im not gonna lie the humour was giving marvel movie which i found really cringy but thats ok ig its not my movie. The script was sooo much better than other nolan films but a good bit of the dialogue was swallowed by the music also why were they mumbling half the time like SPEAK UP MY FRIEND. I needed subtitles i swear anyway i was not a big fan of the way they skimmed over the effects that the trinity test had on the local indigenous groups but what else can u expect from a white director. Anyway i hope you guys enjoyed reading this review because it's obviously the best one. Anyway cillian murphy if u r reading this i love u sm and u did an amazing job ok everyone else pls go and see oppenheimer and give flo and em and cilly lots and lots of money ok bye bye love u xx."

I saw alot of people who say it is a boring movie and I think the reason is they didn't understand many parts.

Oppenheimer will be accused of being connected with communist party. This movie also showcase the political view and some glimpse of Oppenheimer's college life.

",/review/rw9205103/?ref_=tt_urv,"A great biopic with a stacked movie cast! What more can you ask. A lot of clues and relevant links to many things throughout the movie so keep your eyes peeled. Cinematography and some of the mise en scenes were so nice to see. The use of non-diegetic sounds also made this movie, (the chair was literally rocking due to the sound effects, you could feel the sound if that makes sense). What kept this movie from being perfect was the fact that the actual explosion episodes were just a tad underwhelming but that's understandable because the movie isn't just about big explosions. The film actually gives us the insight to what Mr Oppenheimer is holding himself responsible for being the father of the atomic bomb. He's created something that can put an end to the world at once and he has to live with that sense of guilt, it will forever stay. His name will be renowned even after he passes."

It craves multiple watches. The movie jumps right into it, and does not let you off for even a second until the very last moment. It's dialogue is maturely written by Mr. Nolan and shows huge respect to its audience. And the visual aspect of it with all of its glory there to see on the 70mm screen, is a treat that leaves to be craved even after a 3hr runtime. The movie with its pace shows the reality of how the US chased after the making of atomic bomb. The audio of this movie, not just dialogue but soundtrack, movie sounds, everything was masterfully managed by. Ludwig Gorannson, it perfectly supplements the visual storytelling while adding weight to each scene in its own right. And the acting is perfect. Mr. Murphy is exceptional, larger than life in this movie. RDJ is exceptional. Matt Damon is exceptional. Emily Blunt is exceptional. This movie has all the Oscar-nominating performances. The story is grounded to reality of the history, but is at the same time so tense in its execution, it really makes everyone sit on the edge of your seat for the good of latter part of the movie. The direction of the maestro Mr. Nolan is at his top here. Oppenheimer is the Magnum Opus of Nolan. From the first scene, the whole movie is through the eyes of Oppenheimer. The reality and its weight behind being the Father of the Atomic Bomb. This movie is about Oppenheimer, more than that part of the history of making the first Atomic Bomb."

The build up to the test detonation is like no other. Violins, intensity and just amazing shots once the bomb drops. The movie has a great mix of both the personal and work life of Oppenheimer. Where it takes a dive is after the test bomb. I feel like Nolan could've captured more of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the effect it had on the people in Japan. He shows nothing and sort of skips over it. Ending was slightly dragged out but the last scene is breathtaking. Overall one of Nolan's best but a tier below interstellar/ dark night."

Göransson's soundtrack along with the effects depicting Oppenheimer visualizing particles and waves almost brought me to tears. From then on its a fast paced ride taking you through Oppenheimers early study of quantum physics and his involvement in the Manhattan Project. All the while you are placed in an anxious state as you watch his life be scrutinized due to the highly classified nature of the project shifting through time periods. The editing is masterfully done to stitch the ideas and dialogue together. It culminates with a chilling end and a leaves you wondering if the chain reaction he created can ever be stopped.

It literally put me inside Oppenheimer's head, his thoughts, his feelings, He became me. All the characters even is they had no dialogue, just smiles or gazes, leaves a lasting impression on you. I really cant find words to describe this movie, just wanna relive it again. WOW. It seemed like there was no acting in the movie, it was real, like i was seeing the real Oppenheimer with real Einstein, all the scientists felt like they were really themselves, all the other characters, Oppenheimer's wife(Emily Blunt), colleagues, Lewis Strauss(RDJ), everyone was exceptional.

Cillian really catch Oppenheimer perfectly. His struggle with creating the atomic bomb and the questioning of his loyalty to the US at the end will keep you on the edge.

This movie is brilliantly paced and divided to provide an introspective look into his early life and later troubles in an easy to digest way.

Of all the biopics I've watched, this is one of the best in that it manages to tell someone's story well without sacrificing any of its theatrical appeal. The movie is three hours long, but I was never bored. Christopher Nolan does a great job engaging the audience throughout by building suspense and telling the story in a nonlinear fashion, jumping back and forth on the timeline of Oppenheimer's career but linking every piece together masterfully. The movie also does a great job of painting Oppenheimer in a morally ambiguous light, giving credit to him where it was due but not overly heroizing him.

",/review/rw9219434/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer is a very good movie, starring Cillian Murphy as Robert J. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The film is rated R for nudity and sexual themes, so many women are walking out of the theater for what they perceive to be patriarchal oppression. Though that part didn't personally bother me, Christopher Nolan could've deleted those scenes to get a PG-13 rating so the film could've grossed more money. Anyway, Oppenheimer's runtime is 3 hours 15 minutes."

I would say its okay for the ages of 16 and up. There is a faor bit of nudity between Cilian Murphy's character and Florance Pugh's character, but its nothing too over the top.

Additionally, it had some weird decisions regarding music and camera movement that (I'm not an expert on the art of film making but I enjoy it and study it). Can be hard to follow if you don't have enough knowledge regarding American and War history. A small amount of scenes could've in my opinion, done without the loud music as it made it difficult to understand dialogue and feel connected in the story. However, the film had amazing performances by the cast, brilliant use of sound and lighting to influence the audience's emotions as well as incredible visuals that invite you into the story. Creating a historical film can be challenging as the actions of characters and events are extremely limited to what is and was accurate, but Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful film that covers a significant event in history, which needs to be acknowledged more as it has impacted society a lot more than people think."

Pre-production was under way by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. Oppenheimer was filmed in a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time in history, sections in IMAX black-and-white film photography.

26 July 2023,10," Just wow
",/review/rw9217236/?ref_=tt_urv,"Today i watched Oppenheimer in Imax and in all honesty, it's the best movie i have ever seen. Before going today i isolated myself from every Oppenheimer content just because i wanted to be blown away by Nolan and his amazing cast and im so thankful that i managed to dodge spoilers and etc because after leaving the cinema i felt different and moved by the story. I cant exactly explain what this feeling is but i was not the same person that entered the movie theatre. Oppenheimer is a piece of art that you dont only see or observe, you experience it with your entire body and you spend the entire 3 hours on the edge of your seat with your heart pumping harder and harder as the movie progresses. I never felt anything like this before, not even in real life, i remained glued to my seat for the entire movie and i even forgot about eating my popcorn due to this extreme immersion that the director orchestrated. I wish i could erase Oppenheimer from my memory just so i can go and experience it again, in order to feel all of these emotions and feelings thats this masterpiece has to offer. I also gotta talk about the score of this movie and Ludwig Goransson delivers the most perfect soundtrack possible. This score is chilling, epic, beautiful and touching, making it one of the core aspects for immersion and it also builds up anxiety and terror inside the audience, enhancing the greatness of the story itself. The whole sound department did an extraordinary job in this film, it was all just perfect and fitting for the story. Cillian Murphy performs his best role to date as J Robert Oppenheimer and i really dont think anyone would do such an extraordinary job like Cillian did. Cristopher Nolan chose a brilliant cast and they delivered beyond expectations, every single one of them. In my opinion, Nolan and Cillian Murphy deserve the best movie and best actor oscars, respectively, without any contest and even Robert Downey Junior is a contestor for best supporting actor. As i said before, this experience changes you and your worldview is a different one compared to the one you had 3 hours ago and im just so glad that i got the opportunity to watch Nolans, and possibly cinema's best work of all time. Yeah i do recommend the filme its neat."

It always bothers me when a film requires background music for everything, even quiet conversations, that nothing is good enough to survive without musical support. Also bleach bypassing IMAX seems a real waste - why use a lab process that increases grain and reduces contract ratio on the highest resolution film medium available? It all feels pretty one note, style over substance. Dry. Given Nolan's limitless resources it should be much more rounded. I didn't care about anyone, or even really get to know anyone, including Oppenheimer. Overall really disappointing and all the glowing reviews to me feel like everyone has drunk the Kool Aid. The emperor has no clothes. Not sure how much I'm influenced by having read the biography it's based on. Dr George Miller used to say that a film should feel like a great piece of music with highs, lows, quiet, crescendos, pacing. This feels like one very long chorus, and not a great one at that."

But this one was different. My eyes were drawn to the screen every second and mesmerized at every scene. The cinematography did not disappoint, the contrary actually. So glad that Cillian had the opportunity to do the main role, which he did it flawless. Have always loved the way he acted. You could see just through his face what his emotions were. My favorite scene, for sure was the bomb scene. The countdown brought all the audience together and the music was perfect that just accentuated the tension. Loved the way it didn't just exploded that was the obvious thing to happen. It showed the emotion of every character and demonstrated how everything would change after it. And you could say it was literally a bomb because after it everything was explained like an atomic bomb. Can't imagine a better ending. The way it showed the two judgements ( and their similarities) and ended with the einstein conversation. Brilliant! Honestly i wanna watch at least three more times to grasp and fathom every detail. I think even the whole world wouldn't be enough screen to watch because of how beautiful it was. So Christopher Nolan did it again a flawless work witch will be forever in history . He is a genius."

23 August 2023,9," A Story not of Physics, but of Human Nature
",/review/rw9277352/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer is a stunning movie. Visually, it is a masterpiece, and Nolan's commitment to recreating complex visual phenomena without the use of CGI does nothing to hobble his efforts; indeed, it enhances the emotional impact. The choice to cut back and forth between timelines, which some have derided as overwrought, helped develop plot and characterization in a way that kept me on the edge of my seat -- despite already having read American Prometheus and watching what was predominantly three hours of conversation between men in suits. The true genius of this film is to introduce suspense and tension while the audience nevertheless remains constantly aware of the inevitable resolution. Nolan's attention to detail is strict, to the point of testimony in Oppenheimer's hearing being lifted verbatim from transcripts of the real event. Cinematic contrivances are few and far between, and serve only to tie together themes that would otherwise require the sort of exposition that is not amenable to film, even of this length. As a current student of mathematical physics, I only take issue with the minor role that certain physicists -- John von Neumann, Richard Feynman, and others -- played in the script as compared to American Prometheus, and with the limited examination of circumstances shaping Oppenheimer's early life. It pays to know the boy who became the man, and there's much in Oppenheimer's childhood revealed through Bird and Sherwin's mammoth biography that helps to humanize his inner strife, which certainly preceded the bomb but was intensified by it. Ultimately, Nolan's presentation of human conflict against the backdrop of potential annihilation is ambiguous, much like the ethical debate still waged over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and much like the legacy and life of J. Robert Oppenheimer himself. This is to the film's credit. We, the audience, although seeing the world largely through Oppenheimer's eyes, can catch a glimpse of men like Teller and why they acted how they did. Oppenheimer is well worth its runtime. It is a slow-burn Roman candle that pays due homage to a troubled brilliancy of physics and the collective body of Nolan's ouvre."

The first, of course, I was amazed by the acting of Cillian Murphy who played Robert Oppenheimer, who was very charismatic and authoritative. Secondly I really like the story which is very weighty and supported by strong characterization. There is one character that caught my attention, namely Albert Einstein, played by Tom Conti. The star cast that was presented were able to bring the characters they played very well, such as Robert Downey Junior who played Lewis Strauss, Emily Blunt who played Kitty, and Florence Pugh who played Jean Tatlock. This film has a duration of 181 mins, but because the visuals are so slick that it will make you feel comfortable while watching, in some scenes you can really feel the movement of the camera which makes you feel more and more carried into the film. I enjoyed watching this film, my heart was pounding with a visual interlude of explosions and of course it made me tense in one of the most eagerly awaited scenes. Maybe this is enough for my review, you don't need many reasons why you should watch this movie, you have to watch this movie because it's a Christopher Nolan movie, you know what it will be like 🔥."

So I chose to watch again, but iMax quality. In this film, Nolan did not use much dialogues between characters, background music may be enough. I think the most wonderful point of this film is the balance between music, dialogue and the scenes. The story is easy, it's about the bomb, why the US create the bomb. And the experiences of Oppenheimer. His love story, the conflict of himself that whether it's right to create the bomb. Nolan is good at making films, a born director. The screen change between colorful and black. He is good at lead audiences get into the main story. If u don't watch this film yet, u may do not understand what I am talking about.

Firstly, the structure really just made the trial lack build-up. Practically, the last ten minutes or so is where things unfold haphazardly. Almost trying to piece together a cop-out climactic surprise villain ending. Then 'thematic' suspense is just off-putting for what it was trying to do, create a complex view of Oppenheimer. By the end, he was just doing Spielberg's school of Heroes vs Villain. Strauss, very bad man. Oppenheimer, complex but mostly good. Its too simplified for comfort. The use of time could have been more effective in showing the change that the film aims to show with Oppenheimer's view of the bomb to be honest."

The way the time is placed in this film makes this film more complicated than usual films. Overall, I am very satisfied with this film. Maybe this movie is the best movie i've ever watched so far. The IMAX format makes it extraordinary. Maybe a slight drawback is that there are too many facts that happen in one minute and it keeps hitting the audience's brain, but maybe that's what Nolan wants to emphasize on the audience, namely a sense of complexity, confusion, anxiety, reflecting Oppenheimer's regret after what happened in Japan. Truly cinema. Really masterpiece. Salute to the director, director, cast and crew."

",/review/rw9231851/?ref_=tt_urv,"TBH I really surprised with Nolan's 1st Time Writing. Apart from Objective Scenes, Nolan Wrote Subjective scenes in a good manner with some Dark Humors. Especially the convo bw Oppie n Einstein and Oppie n Leslie during end and start of the film vice versa. Music made me rumble during 1st test and football basement meet. Now to the main plot Cinematography. It's Usual Thing for Nolan films to be with Good Cinematography. This is no exception. The Portrait individual shots, top angled shots are really came out well. Few frames are worth to be the wallpapers. For example, Green apple spilling with poison, Cillian's Zoomed in shots, Los Alamos and especially my favorite Pugh's cornered shot hugging Cillain during 2nd sex scene. I felt 2 issues with the Cinematography. 1st one an in and out in Portrait shots. I don't know why it happened but I don't think they done it purposely. 2nd is scaling. We are not gonna see the real blast in film. Only the test bombing is shown in the film. But we couldn't measure the range of the blast since there is no any nearby objects. And Finally to the performance. As usual Cillian, Matt and RDJ Nailed their roles. I felt some warm in heart whenever I saw Conti as Einstein. Blunt gave a notable performance. Pugh's role is not lengthy as the 85%+ of film moving to the main content. Since it's a Biopic you may face some slowness in Screenplay where I'm okay with it."

A true biographical film which latches upon the eyes of J. Robert Oppenheimer; revealing the troubles that come with ""vison beyond this world."" In my personal view, Julius Robert Oppenheimer is a flawed individual: conceited, arrogant, stubborn in his vast intellect, to the extent that his devotion to science and advancement of scientific theory clouds his intrinsic morals. The protagonist is portrayed as logical, with ample ability for reasonable foresight in matters of the political and philosophical impact of his actions, but continues to deceive himself of the moral implications of his ""gadget."" This man knew in his heart of hearts the results of his theory,
fully aware of the eventual display of power and threat of mutually assured destruction in the future. Nolan humanizes a genius of universal proportions, revealing that in-depth understanding of quantum phenomena (or any physical science) does not equate to emotional intelligence, nor basic human empathy."

It is well done, and once you sit through the first 20 minutes, the movie's ADHD back and forth makes sense. To avoid spoilers, I will mention the cinematography. There are 2 scenes that blew me away. One is the Trinity test, which faithfully and almost meticulously recreates actual filmed parts of the test and preparations for it, is bone chilling. The other scene at the end, with another person, makes a great ending, and the accompanying soundtrack almost makes you feel obligated to feel the emotions they are talking about. If possible, I would recommend seeing it in IMAX because it is actually designed for it, and I REALLY want to see it in IMAX now, even though I saw it yesterday. The only downside was the sometimes confusing story, but the overall story is understandable."

The cast, the story and simply every aspect of this film is a masterpiece. Even though film is generally considered an art form, I have yet to encounter a film more worthy of the title of art than Oppenheimer. As I saw critics and media portraying this film at the top of the industry, I had more than high expectations and they were all met. As I was running a bit late to the cinema I didn't have enough time to buy popcorn or any snacks, which was honestly a save of money since all my focus was immediately captured when Oppenheimer showed up on the screen so I am not sure I would even be able to eat it."

Oppenheimer shows that all along, he knew exactly what he was doing, they all knew they were building a bomb with huge destructive capabilities, yet went with it anyway. These people on the project were scientists and the film really shows that there was a fine line of morality that each one was crossing when pushing for innovation, which ultimately led to destruction. In the end, Oppenheimer never regretted what he did, he may have felt remorseful about the deaths, but Nolan captures that really he knew he was the most important man on the planet at the time and people would listen to whatever he had to say. A gentle soul, yet strong egotistical and somewhat political view on the world."

Throughout all three hours, you'll be thrilled by the brilliance of the film, screenplay, music, visual effects, acting, directing, and cinematography. Everything is meticulously thought out and meaningful, making it exceptionally perfect and captivating. You completely immerse yourself in the film and become a part of it, living the lives of the characters, sharing their emotions.

Throughout the entire 3 hours long the movie played for I did not feel bored once at all. There was always something big about to happen that you were just waiting to see, nothing in the film was not needed and everything in it made the movie even better. The cinematography in this movie is absolutely outstanding. The Atomic Bomb scene is one of the best scenes from a movie I've ever seen. When watching the scene for the first time there was about 2 minutes from when the button was pressed to the sound of the explosion, the 2 minutes felt like 20 seconds. During the 2 minutes my heart was beating to an extreme pace and when the sound came the whole theater vibrated feeling like the bomb hit you. But the ending is what makes this movie a true 10/10. Einstein tells Oppenheimer that his whole life he will have to deal with the consequences and regret of his creation.

Oppenheimer is a deep movie, lot's is going on. Be sure and know what you are getting into. It's a brilliant film, but it's not for everyone.

",/review/rw9206347/?ref_=tt_urv,"Probably the most thought-provoking big-budget studio film in the last 20 years. While this was a fine film, the acting was utterly tremendous. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downy Junior, and Emily Blunt put on a true masterclass in acting, dwarfed only by the magnitude of Oppenheimer's life's work: the atomic bomb. Magnificent performances, and as far as big-budget studio films go, Oppenheimer may be second to none. The film had so many layers, and was truly one of the finest examples of the magnitude of life's everlasting consequences. It's silly to say a commercially successful movie will clean up at awards season, but it would be a travesty if the Cillian, RDJ, and Emily Blunt didn't all get a statue, as well as the sound team, and cinematography."

",/review/rw9270493/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer's passion for physics and science shines through in this film. For such a niche topic, it is remarkable how the story remains interesting and carries the suspense that is found in some of these scenes. For that alone it's definitely worth the watch. If that's not enough, there are great performances across the board from a wide array of familiar faces. Personally however, the dynamic between Cillian Murphy and RDJ was the highlight. Like most Nolan films however, the pacing holds the movie back in some parts, and not every buildup leads to a satisfying conclusion."

",/review/rw9274206/?ref_=tt_urv,Powerful film as it has incredible performances from all the cast members (Cillian Murphy and RDJ standouts). Gripping storyline and screenplay and concise in details. It could've been 10 to 15 minutes shorter as there were some scenes which were a bit too dragged or were unnecessary for the story's focus. Powerful cameos by Casey Affleck and Rami Malek ( watch out for the court room scene). The villain might shock you in some extent. The actor that portrays Einstein does a wonderful job even though he didn't have too many dialogues. Is it better than Barbie? Well they are two completely different films so it's difficult to judge them together. Overall this is a film which you shouldn't miss out on: with in the cinemas or once it comes digitally.

While the section on Manhattan Project is interesting, I find many scenes redundant and boring. The film could have been condensed into less duration removing unnecessary scenes.

I think one of the best things about this movie is its casting, I don't think anyone else could have played Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer besides Cillian Murphy and along with Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss. The only thing I think could have been done in casting is choosing someone else for LTG. Leslie Groves and not because Matt Damon is a bad actor his lines just felt forced and his performance was also felt forced. Another thing that this movie did great was it's score, ludwig göransson is one of the best film composers of all time, I genuinely listen to the soundtrack casually now, It's so good. It also has one of the best plot twists in film ever when Dr. David L. Hill who is played by Rami Malek who hasn't talked the entire movie just drops a bombshell at Lewis Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing and testifies against him and support Oppenheimer him even though we all thought he hated Oppenheimer.

I dont really have the habit to see a long film like Avatar 2, so I...I fell asleep a little at the end. The director, Christopher Nolan, is very clever because he made the explosion without ANY CGI. And I find it very ingenious. The color of the whole movie is clever too. It can go from black and white to an abrupt change to color in color: it corresponds to Oppenheimer's subjective experience and constitutes the majority of the film. The other is black and white.

",/review/rw9277238/?ref_=tt_urv,"I think the implied idea behind is: Oppenheimer was not sure about the multi-chain reaction of activating a nuclear bomb will lead to the destruction of the whole earth. Nor he was sure about a nuclear war escalation and international multi-chain reaction after the US own their nuclear weapon. There is an impressive scene when a meeting is held to protest the releasing of the nuclear bomb in the WW2. And Oppenheimer, after such a very hard and uninterrupted time struggling himself, says something like: ""If we human cannot see the power of the nuclear weapon ourself, we will never stop being so curious about its power. Sooner or later it has to be a bomb release into the battlefield, and its terrifying consequence will create a very strong deterrence. Fortunately, releasing two bombs in Japan did not destroy the whole earth, but it did destroy human intention to escalate and put the world into a nuclear war. As for now, we can have a beautiful Oppenheimer film to contemplate."

This movie is not so much a mind bender as the likes of Inception or Memento, nor is it as visually massive in scope as Interception. Instead, Nolan chooses more subtle, but nonetheless marvelous, technical methods to tell the story. Namely, the different pacing between Oppenheimer's POV (color) and Strauss's (B&W) seems to be employed to show two things. One, Oppenheimer's POV moves in hard, quick cuts, showing both the urgency and brilliant speed with which his mind operated. Strauss's is slower, more calculated, showing his true nature (I won't spoil too much, despite it being a true story). Nolan is subtle with this choice, but it is extremely effective. Furthermore, his storytelling choices in major moments of Oppenheimer's life, make us feel as if we are personal observers, rather than the usual birds-eye view, a massive spectacle offers."

Not even a courtroom thriller - just endless questioning of Oppenheimer in a room, and a complete fizzle of an atomic explosion. Acting fine, but I'm in the presence of Einstein and checking my watch!?! This should have had huge tension as Nazi's vs. Allies race - you'd hardly know it was WW2. As a warning about A.

",/review/rw9225307/?ref_=tt_urv,"The problem with Christopher Nolan movies is, that no matter the premise, people will always enter the theatre with incredibly (and sometimes unrealistically) high expectations. I don´t think, many people would get overly excited about watching a 3 hour biopic about Robert Oppenheimer, but put Christopher Nolans name on it and it becomes one of the biggest blockbusters of the year. I am a huge Nolan fan as well but tried to limit my excitement as much as possible, remembering very well that in 2020, I left Tenet kind of disappointed because of my unrealitstically high expectations - even though it was overall a very good movie (after the second viewing that is). For Oppenheimer, it didn´t make it easier, that movie theatres were immediately sold out for days and initial critics (even the ones that were not generated by Chat GPT) were showering it with praise. I finally managed to get a seat in a rather small theatre tonight and have to say: Even with neutral expectations, this movie was a disappointment."

I thought that after the interval maybe this movie will pick up some speed but no it was only dialogues the entire time...dont know why people are liking this trash film. I was expecting something like interstellar or atleast some action sequence. Apart from all this boring stuff the cinematography was good as it was shot on IMAX and cgi wasn't used so if that is a good reason for you to watch this film you can go ahead but I wont recommend this movie to watch in the movie theatre, wait for it to come in the OTT."

This created a real lack of continuity in the telling of the tale. There was a potentially great story to tell here, but it just seemed like a huge pity play for those sucked into the communist theology and what a god awful marriage his wife endured.

They do not show the problems of their project. And the final act does not include the one thing that the thousands of people in WW2 were working to do.

I've seen many movies and I think this takes the cake for the movie that was the least gripping/entertaining. How can you be expected to pay attention to a 3 hour dialogue slog of a movie when you can barely hear the actors talking? I don't think it was a theatre issue but if it was I apologize.

",/review/rw9203956/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer is a film that tries to explore the life and work of the man behind the atomic bomb, but fails to deliver a compelling story or a satisfying conclusion. The film is too long, too slow, and too dense with technical and historical details that only a physics or politics student would appreciate. The characters are bland and unrelatable, the dialogue is dry and dull, and the cinematography is uninspired and boring. The film does not do justice to the complexity and controversy of Oppenheimer's legacy, nor does it offer any insight or emotion to the audience. Oppenheimer is a film that should have been left in the lab. One good scene which was impressive but left me very sober. It was anxiety inducing. Then 30 more minutes and I just hoped the movie will end. It's not just a ""problem"" with Oppenheimer but I noticed with other movies with similar running time. Even The Batman which I loved was slightly too long. Not exactly the same goes with Oppenheimer I felt like an editor and wanted to cut out the last 20 minutes. The movie could have ended on a more impressive note than it actually did. I also didn't really like Nolan's typical beige filter in it. The B/W segments felt refreshing. Weirdly my cinema's 70mm film projector went broke after 30 minutes in. (The first nude scene with Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy). They talked about Freud and Jung and the movie was paused for 20 minutes, just to be replaced by the digital backup. That was an interesting experience. It was my first time seeing a movie in analog and I guess it was also a first time for a long time for the theater. It has its charms. The grain.

There was INCESSANT background noise that rumbled and roared and thudded (with a lot of Sensurround-style vibration) throughout the film. Sometimes it drowned out the actors, several of whom were hard for me to understand in the first place. The style of the photography was also off-putting. To make it seem like a documentary or a period-piece, sections of it were filmed in black-and-white or used filters to deaden the colors. I think all these gimmicks were there to disguise the fact that the script wasn't really very focused and was 3 hours long. The script is based on true historical events, and reality isn't easily shoehorned into a coherent plot. It was never clear to me exactly what the point was. There are a lot of good actors in this movie, but I didn't know who they were until I saw the credits! I still think of Matt Damon and Robert Downey Junior as young men, and they're NOT! I thought Downey gave the best performance in the film, though. The art direction and costume design seemed to accurately depict the period, although thanks to the cinematography, we'll never know what the true colors of anything were. (I wonder if the film-maker told these people that he was going to use stylized cinematography beforehand, or whether they found out when they saw the film.) I admire the film's ambition, and I think the issues it raises are things that people should think about, but I wonder if it would have been better if they had just told the story."

The main issue is that it is boring. The story itself is interesting but the way it is presented is dull. It felt like 3 hour long trailer. Every scene had to be dramatic with over the top dramatic music and dialog. And when you have only dramatic scenes you don't have any dramatic scenes. Even the explosion lacked any actual effect. The only dramatic thing about it was that we had some 30 seconds of quietness. The movie had that stupid dramatic music non-stop. NON-STOP! The actors were fine, put the script was lackluster and I think the cast, the music, all the drama and the way the story was presented was because they knew the scrips was bad. Also I don't know who that movie targets. I feel like years ago history movies targeted people who would appreciate them and because they were done with a lot of love to the story, attention to details and made interesting they were appealing not only to history buffs. Nowadays historical movies target everybody so they are no longer historical but exaggerated dramas that are only inspired loosely by history. The movie really sucks."

It is NOT worth watching in the cinema, there is very poor usage of sound effects. It's just loud for no reason. Only the bomb effect was great, but rest is just very loud noise for no good reason and you just don't want to hear at it full blast when people are clapping or similar loud noises. It provides absolutely no effect other than you want to close your ears. Also bad cinematography, random use of white/black coloring for no good reason. It's not used as flashback there is no consistency of using white/black here and there it's just random and doesn't make the film anymore interesting, completely unnecessary. IMO the worst film Christopher Nolan has produced so far. If not for amazing acting, I would've left the cinema. 3 hours used to tell a story that could EASILY have been boiled down to 1,5 hours. 30-40% of the movie is about an interrogation that has real consequense or impact to the audience, it just seems like an awful long waste of time because. Some guy felt leftout so he decided to run a cross examination of Oppenheimer, which leads to nothing except he can't have his security clearance re-approved. Why would you Nolan spent 40% of the film on this utterly boring part? I honestly beats me how people can enjoy this movie.

He doesnt pay any attention to the story hes telling he is more focused on trying to prove something by using a senseless non linear style of storytelling that adds no value to the story whatsoever. Watching a Christopher Nolan film nowadays is just like watching a self portrait of himself. It doesn't have anything to do with the story or the film. Making both the story and the film unentertaining, unmemorable and boring."

The screenplay and scriptwriters fell short, resulting in a convoluted and confusing narrative. Despite Nolan's attempts to overdo things, the weak foundation couldn't support the complexity. The music lacked a thematic connection to the storyline, leaving the overall experience underwhelming. While the film showcased impressive visuals and cinematography, it couldn't compensate for its flaws. A five-star rating for technical prowess, but the execution fell flat, leaving me wanting more from this talented director. Hoping for a better show next time around."

",/review/rw9234656/?ref_=tt_urv,"The movie is okay. Wasted in IMAX. The music production is at best, oppressive, intrusive and a distraction from what are great actors doing their thing. The script might have multiple layers but it lacks conflict, an inciting incident and a meaningful resolution. It's linear, which biopics tend to be, but it's not a 'story'. Flawed genius? Perhaps or just an unfaithful man - not ground breaking and it lacked a real reason to 'be'. It might have been better if Heisenberg and Oppenheimer were enemies instead of friends or some personal conflict existed that resulted in a winner. Here the movie falls flat and tries to use over bearing music to fill a void left by a lifeless underdramatic script."

One minute he's in a classroom the, next he's in the desert on a horse. Parties, classroom, back on a horse. WHY!?! It did seem like the film was slowing down when he was recruited for the Manhattan Project but by that point I'd lost all faith in the film. Maybe when it finally hits Netflix or something I'll start it again from where I left but that was one of the worst hours of cinema I've ever witnessed.

I cannot believe a master like Nolan can take such a juicy subject and turn it into the most tedious endurance tests one will ever face in a movie theatre. If you're interested in the Manhattan project you'll get a glimpse of it.

Odd bits were good but the constant jumping about was annoying. The casting was stereotyped although the actors did the best they could in the circumstances. And why did the sound have to be so deafening? The visual effects were cliched. Real pictures of an atomic bomb going off are dramatic enough without the swirling clouds.

I have just enough knowledge to know who Oppenheimer was but didnt know the full story behind him. There was constant time hopping and so many substories within the main story I couldn't keep track of what and why all these were relevant. Not to mention tons of characters and no idea how they were related to what was happening or their importance. As someone who is interested in learning about history I really tried to hang with it and just couldn't. Maybe different editing would help, definitely less time hopping and more information on the characters. Hoping someone remakes this with clearer overall definition."

Half o the movie is a combination of a boring meeting that never ends - you get one of these every day at work - and a mock trial. Moreover, add to it a lack of intellectual depth in all the conversations. The movie really misses the mark on all the aspects of plot/action, a shallow to no conversation/dialog between actors, unmoving/ordinary scenes, and a lack of character development. Add to it a continuous annoying sound that is meant to fill in stridently for the lack of emotion because the movie never gets going.

Unlike this, Oppenheimer dissappointingly, is a flat, uninspired, rushed but deadly long movie. Most characters had inadequate acting range. We all know what Cillian's acting range is, honest to goodness, do you think he gives even the half of it? I do not believe that its his inability but the limitations put by the long and non-linear scenario.

The dialogue is atrocious. Character introductions were cliche. The subjective black and white story line was unnecessary. It's tough to make a three hour movie feel rushed and empty but Christopher Nolan managed to pull it off in Oppenheimer. Sadly, it seems as though this Barbie/Oppenheimer scheme Hollywood pulled to get us all back in the theater to see these movies (at least from my perspective) failed. Oppenheimer's only shred of decency is it's use of sound and some scenes cinematography. Outside of that this movie is not worth seeing in theaters."

It has to be one of the worst theatrical experiences I've had in recent memory, I'd have expected it to be a technical issue it was so bad but was told by the staff at the theater this was just the way it is. Since it is a Christopher Nolan picture, I'm not surprised. He's had similar issues in the past most recently with Tenant where, according to interviews with Nolan, he intentionally covered up dialog.

The film is also too long, dragging on for nearly three hours, with no tension or excitement. People were literally sleeping in the hall, and I don't blame them. Oppenheimer is a disappointing and boring film that does not do justice to its subject or its audience. It is a waste of time and money. I give it one star out of five. I regret wasting my time."

This movie makes me think of the imitation game and how that movie did so many things well and how this movie didn't teach me anything new or leave me feeling any different when I think of this part of history. I would much rather see a new perspective included (native displacement to create los alamos, women in stem, how Oppenheimer lived rest of his days or his early life), would love to see more Olivia thirlby. I am a big fan of Nolan, but this fell short of all the hype. The music was unremarkable, didn't include any new perpectives, and was an hour too long focusing on characters that were uninteresting."

Oppenheimer is fast paced in some scenes but is painfully slow in other scenes. The intimate scenes added nothing of value. This movie is overrated because big casts are in it thats all. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of peaky blinders. This is just name tags attached its not genius and it certainly is not the best thing you will ever see.

I think the film was a bit ambitious and honestly way over-hyped. There were a lot of story lines that seemed unnecessary to include and definitely could've been shortened down. It was a little hard to follow at some points, and they mumbled a lot with very background music that was louder than the dialogue so sometimes I got lost, everyone in my group had the same complaint. The actual bomb scene as well was just extremely overhyped; that was probably the quietest part of the movie. Cillian Murphy did a great job. Some characters also just very random.

I fell asleep and was unfortunate enough to wake up again with still 2 of the 3 hours to go. If I hadn't been there with my family I would have left. Christopher Nolan seemed more intent on proving his own intelligence than being a good storyteller. The messing around with the chronology was an example of this, as for me it detracted from the story rather than enhancing it.

Oppie's character was way too flat as I always feared it would be ever since the Cillian Murphy was announced. Yes, Nolan released some great movies throughout his career but his lack of natural skill when it comes to emotional intelligence and intimacy was always evident and it really shows and bothers this time. As someone who's deeply interested in science and its rapid development in the 20th century, the film seemed too dull and uneventful to me, even the way it dove into racial issues fell flat and seemed artificial."

The movie kept jumping around between time periods before the war and after the war, showing all kinds of scenes out of sequence, which if done right can be very effective, but in this movie it was done wrong, very wrong. A simple ""1939"" on the screen would've made things clear, but I guess we're just supposed to know. Even at the end of this three hour long marathon I was still confused about many of the scenes, and it wasn't just about the time periods, but the dialogue itself was confusing. Half the time I didn't know what or who they were talking about, and the last hour, after the bomb exploded, was not only boring and confusing, but also entirely pointless and the movie would've been better without it. In addition, they added in these scenes, presumably for dramatic effect, that were intended to show the character's emotions or thought process at the time, showing us what he was feeling but was not actually happening, and that too missed the mark for me. Much of it was just awkward and annoying. It wasn't all bad. The acting was very good, and some of the scenes were very powerful, but overall I'm still very disappointed in this movie.

Personally I think some scenes should be better especially Oppenheimer's university days and his mental health. The VFX was simply stunning,Nolan was not kidding when he said that he is gonna detonate a real bomb. The pace was giod but some scenes felt rushed especially the beginning. I like the fact that Nolan did not glorify the main character or make him likeable like most biopic directors tend to do. The ending was simply superb. Overall this is not Nolan's best movie but arguably one of his movies to be remembered. Now, coming to the point why I gave it 1 instead of a 8 is because of one scene. Yes it is the bhagavad gita scene. I don't know if Nolan wanted to convey something by keeping a holy book in midst of a sex scene or just wanted to do introduce bhagavad gita and he did not care about the significance of the book, be it any reason keeping a holy book of a religion in a sex scene and not less near a women's private parts is just not accepatable and is disrespectful to the religion. Just imagine if it was bible instead of bhagavad gita would'nt it be mortifying. The director and actor should respond to this or delete the scene from the movie itself."

",/review/rw9205784/?ref_=tt_urv,"This film has everything laid out. I have been looking forward to it for months. Like others, Nolan is one of my favorite directors, nay, probably my favorite director of all time. All the critics raved about this film. The trailer made it look like something that I could take my kids to for the discussion I expected we would have afterward - even if I had to cover their eyes during the nude scenes. I was expecting to come out of this picture blown away and I even paid $25 to see it with a friend in IMAX first just to double check it was tween friendly enough. Well, I am sorry to say it was an enormous let down. Was it a decent flick? Sure. The cinematography was good, the story is interesting kind of, but let's be real here, Oppenheimer himself is not the interesting part of the story, the bomb is. The fact that you have to murder tens of thousands of people in order to save tens of thousands more. What the bomb does to people who aren't vaporized when it goes off. This was just barely touched on in the film. There are no scenes of mathematicians working feverishly, no real feeling of how large of a project this must have really been. There are snippets of things here and there about the project, but this really is JUST A BIOPIC of Oppenheimer. And somewhat of this Strauss guy that history pretty much has forgotten. And truth be told, none of it was really that interesting to me. Feynman would have made a much more interesting film, IMO. So, was it OK? Yeah, it was OK. Am I glad I spent $25 to see this in the theater? Nope. This is a rental, if you have nothing better to watch. But do yourself a favor, go get The Dark Knight or Interstellar and watch that again - you'll be happier in the end. If you want something kind of along the same vein that's a better movie, see The Imitation Game. If you are looking for.a thought provoking movie, watch The Fog of War."

Without any sort of context, the science is a meaningless abstract reference and the real story is lost.

",/review/rw9227842/?ref_=tt_urv,"Contrary to Christopher Nolan's advice, the ""ideal"" way to watch this movie is in a concrete bunker with gun range headphones. It is absolutely too load to watch. As a veteran of Hendrix, Who, Stones, and Pink Floyd, I left after 10 minutes and got my money back. Thank goodness I didn't travel to one of the 30 theaters on the PLANET, that have the full IMAX experience. Frankly, while the visuals of New Mexico are wonderfully done, the story itself did not need that film quality. But, I'm sure the Hollywood crowd will applaud and award an Oscar that I see as blatantly bought. It's really no different that the campaigns companies put on to drum up support at Oscar time."

30 July 2023,1," boring and look cheap movie
",/review/rw9226554/?ref_=tt_urv,"The movie was fail to educate people about the process of the atomic bomb, where the source, how it done. A single osciloscope? Come on. Even there was no B-29. Nolan did not want CGI? Thats why it make this move cheap. Even the transporting of the ore has movie, the ship that carry that bomb has a single movie, process dropping it has a movie, I expect movie like unbroken (CGI? Yes but clean)
You know what they use to picture the uranium? Marbels, hahaha. And you know what the bomb was lego. As I know the bomb was solid iron."

",/review/rw9230226/?ref_=tt_urv,"The title speaks for itself. I was very much looking forward to this movie. It took only 45 minutes for me to be ready to walk out. The only reason I stayed was the hope for the movie to get better or at least progressively come close to expectations. What we got was a directors personal interpretation and failed attempt at ""art"" that became painful to witness. A confusing plot that even at the end gave little insight to what was trying to be portrayed. This film tried so hard to be the Citizen Kane of it's time. This attempt fell far short of everyone's expectations at the theater. A quarter of the movie was bearable and the rest, downright disappointing. The whole movie is fixated on telling a confusing story of 2 peoples perspectives of events along with a personal vendetta, and a kangaroo Court. Oh, and I think at one point they actually talked about making a nuclear bomb or something but that wasn't the main story line to what the film was about. At the end of the movie I heard a fellow moviegoer say ""What did I just watch"". This film took 3 hours of my life I will never get back, Although it's probably going to win an Oscar."

Even previews of people just talking was causing me hearing damage I didn't want to wait for oppenheimer to start and find out what a nuke sounds like and burst my ear drums. This was the stupidest thing ever, there is no reason to play a movie at that volume, I couldn't even tell you a single preview I saw because I was just thinking about how loud it was and the hearing damage it was causing. 6 hours later now and my hearing is still diminished because of 5 minutes of this. Shame on you Imax, I hope this doesn't cause permanent hearing loss."
28 July 2023,3," Nudity wasn't necessary
",/review/rw9220435/?ref_=tt_urv,"Had it not been for the nudity, I would have loved this movie. So disappointed in the decision to lower such standards for trashy scenes. We can understand that people are nude without actually having to view it. Several of us saw the movie together and agreed the nudity was completely uncalled for. Don't we get enough of society trying to shove that junk down our throats? Just adding to the problem of too many hormones running around to the point of affecting children and all the human trafficking problems. So disappointed in this film and it's director and producers. It could have been such an amazing film."
23 July 2023,4," Long and boring
",/review/rw9209454/?ref_=tt_urv,"""Openheimer"" was meant to be a captivating exploration of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and the atomic bomb's development. Unfortunately, it fell far short of expectations. This is not a movie for fans of Interstellar or Inception. This is a very long and very boring movie about a guy in a suit who figured out how to kill other people in an spectacular way. The amount of meetings and discussions going on reminds me of corporate calls on teams. Nolan jumps around timelines. Getting caught up in this maze is difficult and tiring. It was a terrible movie. In the end I left the cinema after two hours."
23 July 2023,2," Too loud, confusing; Nolan should've used CGI to do the ""big event"" to make it accurate..
",/review/rw9208528/?ref_=tt_urv,"First off, I like Nolan's movies to varying degrees. My favorite is the Batman trilogy, although I do fast-forward through the end of movie 1 (if I recall), as it's too violent. As for this movie:
First, in the coming attractions, it had the words ""we saved (or we're saving) a million soldier's lives"" and from what I remember, that comment wasn't in the movie (and it's important to understand in the context of bomb). Also, many times I couldn't understand the dialouge because the background music/noise was too loud and/or the words sounded distorted. I ended up going to the lobby and they did turn the volume down a little (they said they couldn't turn it down any further - were they under orders to have it only at a certain sound volume level?). I was totally confused about all the Washington D. C. hearings. Why SO MUCH TIME taken on this and the whole ""commie""/""noncommie"" stuff? Are there those in the audience who DIDN'T know that creating the first nuclear bomb and dropping it on Japan was very a controversial thing and that at the tiime we had a communist threat too? Was the Downey character in the movie just to provide an antagonist? I twice looked at my phone to see the time and midway through, I walked to the lobby for a break. Oh, and Nolan should've used special affects for the ""big event"". Everyone knows that an A-bomb has a very distinct mushroom cloud."
19 July 2023,1," A Lackluster, Mediocre Cinematic Endeavor
",/review/rw9201198/?ref_=tt_urv,"Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a film that falls disappointingly short of its potential. While it attempts to delve into the intriguing life and contributions of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist and key figure in the development of the atomic bomb, the execution of the film leaves much to be desired. Here are a few reasons why Oppenheimer fails to deliver on its promise."

",/review/rw9229760/?ref_=tt_urv,"Firstly i would like to say i am not being harsh. I am being completely honest and with that, i think this movie was extremely dull and boring. I should've researched it before hand because i didn't know how dragged out and boring the plot was going to be. It was a type of movie where you have to have a high attention span & just have to be a smart person in general. The movie is based around science & history but the wording and everything about it just wasn't it. I found myself dozing off multiple times and if i'm being completely honest the only part i understood about that movie is when they actually set off the atomic bomb. Other than that it was shocking😂😂😂"

22 July 2023,5," A disappointment
",/review/rw9207183/?ref_=tt_urv,"I simply can't like this movie. It wants to say way too much and says way too little about way too many things. It can't decide what it wants to be, so it's not really anything - not just for the viewer, but for the creator. And that's a problem. It's not good as a biopic: there are serious historical flaws in the story, which irritated me. I'm a huge fan of John von Neumann... anyone, who knows who he was understands why I mention him. As a drama? The movie can't decide the centre of the drama. It's too weak as a spy-story, too weak as a political drama, too weak as a personal drama. Not one aspect is worked out to carry the film. The strongest aspect was how many times in american history the ""what you did 20 years ago is more important than who you become and what your expertese is"" ruined people's lives. Or at least was used as a political rethoric against opponents. And I appreciated that, hence the 5 points. As a moral/personal evolution the moral conflict isn't built up, the ""evolution of a scientist"" dies away halfway and doesn't really connect with the ""organizer scientist"". The ""science should or should not have moral boundaries"" isn't worked out and built up, just comes and goes without a purpose. The only detactable personal evolution is the ""man of future becomes the man of past"", but somehow that remains too weak in the end, too. So the movie falls apart and not even the brilliant actors and the massively impressive explosion scene can hold it together."
31 July 2023,4," Very average movie but hyped.
",/review/rw9228975/?ref_=tt_urv,"Yes, it is a very average movie but hyped by the audience. Nolan fans have rated movie very well because they experienced the placebo effect. The movie is nothing special. I must acknowledge that the acting of every actor in the movie is top-notch. What I felt was bad, is the way storyline was presented; nothing creative was tried. Also, the movie is very dialogue intensive. At the end of the movie, I just felt that a lot of facts were poured into my head. Direction is slightly above average. From the perspective of students persuing science in graduation, the movie doesn't have much part of science; they could have showed how great Oppenheimer was in terms of his academic achievements and what all he did, instead, they choose to just say in a one-liner through dialogues!!!"
23 September 2023,4," Historically important, very well made, but incredibly boring.
",/review/rw9337064/?ref_=tt_urv,"After the media hype I had half a hope this movie might be gripping. I was entirely wrong. If I'm not mistaken, I think I saw the word 'action' used in relation to this, If I did then it's laughable. So much God damned talking!!! Never ending talking. The only action part was a nuclear explosion but even that was a bit disappointing for me. I would have expected that in 2023 the very latest sound processing tools would have truly shook the cinema, that the blast was the blast to end all fictional blasts in the history of blasts. But no such thing. Just a bunch of test footage I'm sure Iv seen somewhere before. I do not understand how this film is languishing at the top of this list? Surely somebody paid somebody to make that happen? That includes the 8.6 rating too."
9 August 2023,1," Disappointing and overrated!
",/review/rw9248371/?ref_=tt_urv,"As much as I love Christopher Nolan but this is easily the worst movie directed by him. I was expecting something similar to inception based on the hype given before releasing the movie. The only thing that I love about the movie is how Cillian Murphy represented the character very well and his role was acted perfectly well. On the other hand, the supporting actors/actresses were lost in this movie. They weren't given a chance to show their full potential. And i truly hate when Hollywood glorify the United States name in their movies as though whatever was done is good to mankind. Also, I found it extremely disrespectful for the other countries such as Japan were it was victimized in this movie. Overall, the movie was extremely boring with so much non sense dialogues to prolong it and reach the 3-hour mark."

",/review/rw9212026/?ref_=tt_urv,"Movie does not live up to the expectations. I watched it with great anticipation that it will be a fun mind blowing movie that lives up to the core of openhimer's life. To talk about the movie the build up upto the bomb test scene is amazing and the hype gets real, but the sound comes too late and kills the vibe. It was good to delay the sound but the director delayed it too much. Robert Downey Jr's character was amazing and his revelation as antagonist was terrifically amazing. Well his character only made the second half good, props to the writer! . when openhimer's character was being interrogated the hype was building up and died down at an instant which was a source of another disappointment. Worst thing about this movie was that unnecessary sex scene. It certainly seemed like the director wanted to reduce the significance of the holy scripture Bhagvad Geeta's significance from openhimer's life. He must have done it to not show himself as a Hinduism promoter. It was certainly the worst way possible. I have to say it was a waste of money. So I rate it 1 star. This movie is only running because of Christopher's reputation. So,Reducing 3 star will be the actual rating for this movie."

",/review/rw9296103/?ref_=tt_urv,"The film proves engaging on a global level, even though some parts are tedious. However, it's truly senseless that the remarkable Enrico Fermi has received inadequate visibility. He embodies the crucial figure who provided fundamental guidance to all other characters, playing an essential role in the project's realization. For those who might not know, it's important to underline that Fermi is the inventor of the reactor, a contribution without which the achievement of atomic energy would have remained an unattainable goal, significantly altering the course of history. The film's message resonates-Fermi's legacy demands recognition."
21 July 2023,1," Horrible
",/review/rw9205050/?ref_=tt_urv,"Don't watch! Sheer wastage of money. Only lawyers might like this film. Christopher Nolan please retire gracefully than making mediocre films like these! Whatever was good was shown in the trailer nothing new. Switching between black and white was stupid. Was not hooked to it in the first few minutes. First two hours were really draggy and slow. Atomic explosion, has so much expectations from that shot, but it was just average. My nephew slept through the film (who has never done that till date)."
24 July 2023,3," Exclusion from Nolan's latest film (one perspective on Nolan's R-rating).
",/review/rw9212215/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan used to be able to be counted on for delivering high quality, thought provoking, educated films that never ventured into the explicit (be it sex, nudity, or language). The majority of his previous films were standards of excellence, always looked forward to, and never required audiences to worry about what content they were about to see. I think many Hollywood professionals underestimate the amount of viewers who filter entertainment they see by their individual moral codes and consciences. Great storytelling (especially in writing) should be able to be portrayed without relying on the explicit. Would have loved to have been a Oppenheimer fan, but unfortunately Nolan has excluded viewers like myself from his latest film."
5 August 2023,4," A good story badly told
",/review/rw9240602/?ref_=tt_urv,"This very heavily marketed, promoted and hyped film was hugely disappointing. The acting is outstanding and there is some good writing, but it is riddled with unnecessary and ineffective narrative gimmicks and visuals of explosions, space, sub-atomic particles etc. They might have worked if used with better judgment and discernment, but they don't. They're just annoying and tiresome. Same goes for the heavy-handed and over the top score. I felt that most of this was in service of the director's ego rather than the film itself."

I have never heard him referred to anything besides ""Ken"", so I assumed he just had some sort of Nordic/Germanic/Jewish heritage that Matel didn't tell us about.

31 July 2023,5," A Feature Film of a man Struggling with his Colleagues
",/review/rw9229841/?ref_=tt_urv,"Christopher Nolan looks more like an indie director making movies in Hollywood. He breaks the traditional recipe of the blockbuster popcorn movie with a plot rather interested in breaking up the story of a WWII character, than in making a story of high intensity and drama, as is the type of Hollywood cinema. I'd say the movie is OKAY, but people and pop culture aren't ready for 3 hours of Oppenheimer getting in trouble for his ""uncertain"" communist party relation, and his bad vibes with his boss."
